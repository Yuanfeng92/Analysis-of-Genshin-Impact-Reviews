0,Joy SQ.,"Besides everything that people say, this game is amazing! I love that there is constant gameplay. There is so much intel on everything, makes you actually understand what you need to do for leveling up. I will say there are some stuff I would love to include, such as... Having a trading system for a better way to buy stuff especially rations. I always have those going down. And the villages don‚Äôt restock as fast when I am doing back to back events. I would also like if we could actually do quests in multiplayer. I feel like that would be awesome. Because of just how much power they hold, it would be nice to have some backup. But this app literally contains so much stuff to adventure in. You can interact with literally everything! I love that I can play with my friend and help them battle out some of the creatures around the map. I do say, you might have to watch tutorials just to get the basics. But then it is like an easy reflex to figure everything out. And the graphics of this game is also out of this world. It is kinda laggy being in multiplayer and on call. But all of that I still have an excellent gameplay. And I love the character design, thought I think the main characters could have more avatar options. I wish we could decorate our main character or find people who could give us clothes to buy. Thank you for this game it is such a joy to just have something to do and leveling up my characters!",5,My Favorite Game ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,2020-10-21 23:57:01,False
1,DiggingDiva,"Words cannot describe how impeccable this game is. I have never in my life seen a game quite like genshin. The graphics are ‚ÄòBreath of the Wild‚Äô tier (seriously), the game runs extremely smooth with rarely any lag at all, the story is fascinating and exciting, the character development is phenomenal, and it is overall extremely gorgeous and aesthetically pleasing. I have played hundreds of rpg games, most of which I payed money for, and none of them have even come close to the quality and beauty of this game. There is so much attention to detail in every little part that it is so hard to not fall in love with (there‚Äôs cooking, characters to acquire, storylines to follow, constellations to unlock, mini side stories to collect all in the world in the form of books - just to name a few). NOT TO MENTION ITS FREE. I have never once received an ad while playing the game, nor does it spam your screen constantly with in game purchases. One of my favorite parts of this game is all of the voice acting. Pretty much every character has a voice over, which makes it feel so much more real. They all have their own personalities and traits which make them so much more personal and interesting. I have not found one thing to complain about with this game yet, and tbh I don‚Äôt think I ever will. This game is truly fantastic and a beautiful work of art. 10/10 recommend to anyone. You won‚Äôt regret downloading this game, trust me.",5,The most impressive game I‚Äôve ever played.,2020-12-03 03:05:55,False
2,dontunderestimateme,"I wish I found out about this game later when more stuff is released, that way I could grind for that much longer. I‚Äôm AR 37 and this game is super fun. I‚Äôve spent an average of 5 hours or so everyday playing this game since I got it. 

I loved BOTW, it was one of my fave games, and this was obviously inspired by it, but other parts of Genshin make it unique in its own way. Great character personalities and designs, great story, and funny, interesting dialogue, entertaining gameplay... this is why it‚Äôs so addicting. I love Childe and Xiao they‚Äôre so cute. And I would‚Äôve expected Paimon to be annoying, but she is actually really fun to have as my guide and her sassy attitude is amazing lol. Despite the traveler being silent, his replies are sassy and hilarious as well‚Äî to Paimon and to other characters in general. I‚Äôm glad his voice was added in the the voice over section of the game with Paimon. 

UGH, this game is just so good and I‚Äôm going to be sad once I run out of things to do on it since the game is so new. My only complaint is the ridiculous rates on Gacha. They‚Äôre not kidding when it says the chance to get a five star is .6 percent or whatever. At least make it 1 percent because dang... also, make artifacts and weapons a little bit more accessible as well. Otherwise, this is one of the best mobile games I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôm happy for Mihoyo‚Äôs huge success in sales in this game as well! I‚Äôm so grateful for u guys and keep producing great content!! üíñüíñ",5,Super addicting,2020-11-26 06:03:03,False
3,Tronscream,"In my many years of trying to find games to play on the phone and ACTUALLY being satisfied and having something to play till 3 am. Genshin Impact has shown me that I waited long enough, the game asked me to write a review but I just couldn‚Äôt stop playing at the time. I have a few suggestions but the game doesn‚Äôt need major changes the updates are spontaneous but that is to come of a new game so it‚Äôs not a complaint, if you‚Äôre looking for a game that you can like and that has beautiful graphics along with fighting mechanics then this is your game. With the dungeons and monsters and many different places to visit it‚Äôs even fun just running around looking at the world, although one suggestion I have is that instead of just food to heal your party members why not add craftable health potions and such so my character doesn‚Äôt feel sick when eating so much üòÇ. The purity and smooth play of the game is phenomenal though, I‚Äôve already suggested it to a dozen people and I think this game has greater potential, on the other hand I was opening this was a open world multiplayer aswell, but the story says otherwise. If you need to relax and relieve stress this is the game, but if you want to play with friends and find people to meet you better have them added or you‚Äôll be alone like I am! All in all having a better friends system would be awesome but the game itself is phenomenal! Paimon is so Kawaii!!!!!",5,The most successful open world game,2020-10-01 18:31:58,False
4,Hello Peoples And Creators,"So. The only problem I have with this game is the overwhelming lag that this game brings to the phone. If you guys could really fix this, I‚Äôd be very happy, cause I was Interested to see all of the amazing animations that you guys could bring to such a magnificent game as this one. Plus, it should be brought to my attention that you should get the material for wishes easier. I have been trying my hardest, but I always seem to get nothing, although I just do quests and stuff that don‚Äôt have them. (I understand that this is a very early version of the game, and your improving it.) Also, VERY. good job on the character models for this game. Honestly, this is the first ever good RPG game, making the fact that all the others were not very good, since it limits you to a lobby, not experiencing the world, and just fighting. I would also like to add, something That would improve this game a lot is if you guys had different Customizations. Like Clothes, Wing Gliders (there are 3 available so, I guess I have a wrong point there) And much more! It would seem to me so fun if there was a whole variety to this game. Also, Amazing game on the characters. I really like all of them, and I favor this game a lot. As being one of your big fans, please take these ideas into suggestion and improve the game early on! I would love to see this game being one of the most played games in the world ! ! I hope the best of luck to you guys!",5,Amazing! But...,2020-10-01 21:47:12,False
5,ramƒìn,"I think the game is super fun and in the past few weeks I‚Äôve already gotten to ar 31! I love the characters and story lines, the only complaints I have are about the gacha and the mobile app. The gacha system isn‚Äôt too bad compared to other but it definitely isn‚Äôt the best. To get a 5 star character you want is extremely hard if you don‚Äôt have luck. Having to spend money for more primo gems to get something good is inevitable. Every 90 wishes guarantees you a 5 star but that‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre wishing on the same banner. And that 5 star isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be a character. The free characters you get while playing the game are descent, but the characters obtained from wishes are definitely more desirable. 

The mobile app is great except occasionally it glitched and kicks me out of the game. The loading screen had been working fine until recently, whenever I try to play I have to wait on the white loading screen for about 2 minutes before actually being able to play. Which isn‚Äôt bad but it definitely isn‚Äôt practical. The other thing is when one of the story lines includes ‚Äúanimations scenes‚Äù or some bigger scenes it always glitches on my iPad. Which is such a bummer because I would love to see the beautiful scenes ü•∫. My I pad is fairly new being a gen 7 so I guess there are some glitches to be expected since it‚Äôs mobile and not a pc. But overall I love this game to death and the cute characters that come along :))",4,Runs pretty good on mobile üíÉ,2020-11-10 22:55:46,False
6,... well then.,"I‚Äôm one of those people who Judges a game by its video/screenshots/price/platform rather than description so at first, I personally thought it was some copy or ripoff of another game that costs 60$ more that will be left unnamed, but it‚Äôs much different. There are some things I would love changes too like, you don‚Äôt start with so much stuff, you can have two to three characters out as an a.i. that you can switch to when you need them for a puzzle or you want to get them out of a predicament instead of having one out at a time and hear characters that may not be there, with that edition you could have a healer and strategize rather than switching to what you need when you need it out of nowhere. Another thing is that the gameplay and story through me off from how original and fun it was for a game I was initially going to play as a time waster. I would quiet enjoy to have more skins for your characters and voiced dialogue/more story into the main character instead of a random flying thing that always seems starved. I love the mystery so if you are into that sort of thing I think that you would like it although even with fast travel, travel is quiet annoying and unfortunately, I have no ideas for that

TL/DR: You should play because of story and animations if not because it‚Äôs free

7,Kailyn Sanford,"So at first I was going to play this on PC, yet my computer is pretty slow and this game doesn‚Äôt work very well on it, so I usually play in my phone. So far I‚Äôm at Adventure Rank 27, and I‚Äôve had almost no problems with the game. The storyline is great and there‚Äôs almost always something to do whether it‚Äôs the main story, side quests, daily commissions, or just exploring. The one thing that‚Äôs bad about this, as I‚Äôve seen mentioned a lot before, is the resin system. The resin is the main part of the game that helps you level faster, but it regenerates at 1 per 8 minutes with a limit of 120. This can lead to a boring hour of just wandering and waiting for the resin to regenerate. Now onto the effect it has on my device. I‚Äôve seen others say that it heats up your device pretty quickly, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs only a tiny bit faster at heating your device up as other games are. Now the devise I use is an IPhone SE that I got in October 2020, so it‚Äôs fairly new and had lots of storage when I decided to download. I‚Äôm glad I had lots of storage available because this game takes up around 4GB and more of storage on your device. The 4GB was expected thought because of the amazing game graphics and quality of gameplay, which at first glance does not look like it could fit on a mobile device.

8,JJchan94,"Many people play this on mobile complain how slow the updates is but personally I see it as it‚Äôs also a pc game as well ( I play mobile due to my pc is not good enough to load it apparently). Things take time to make and program and compare to those mmo rpgs online back in the days it‚Äôs reasonably paced. The graphic is amazing, story is decent too. The only thing I personally don‚Äôt like is the summon system. How rare it is to get a 5*. I personally don‚Äôt spend money on games unless I feel this game is WORTH the money (aka if I truly enjoy it and not just cuz of op/cute characters) let‚Äôs be real majority of mmorpgs require grind and wait and ... stuff, this is the same. If you like to get op really fast and then blow pass people and play few min a day with all the 5* summons.. I‚Äôm sorry go download some idle game instead because you are NOT gonna play long in this (plus it‚Äôs a waste of money...) The energy system is a little annoying due to once you are out... no more dungeon runs for artifact/upgrade material but there is bosses, other materials to get so it‚Äôs ok. Plus it‚Äôs not good to game all day so it‚Äôs good to limit game play a little for people can enjoy the little things in life and relax a little. Over all this game to me is a full 5* thank you for whoever read this to the end since I know majority of the people are too lazy to pay attention.",5,Amazing game but there is flaws,2020-11-17 05:28:54,False
9,Reagan Simpson,"I never usually play these kinds of games. Lately even, I‚Äôve been playing things like Escape from Tarkov and have been fiddling around in Conan Exiles. But this game is insane. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, but at first I thought it would be one of those overcrowded mmo‚Äôs with a poorly written story but I have been and stayed intrigued in even side quests! The music is beautiful, the way it was written so well for all the different places and events, I love the effort they put into it. Graphics are pretty good, they‚Äôre not intended to be top of the line realistic or anything so for the type of game it is, the graphics are quite beautiful. This is a game where you‚Äôre not required to pay to play (of course, it makes things easier), despite it being free. You can actually earn currency and things such as primogems just from quests and exploring, and leveling up becomes really difficult after a while but it‚Äôs obviously still possible. The game is all around easy to grasp and the characters are each unique and well made. I‚Äôve been glued to this game for the past few weeks and that‚Äôs saying something for myself. I usually like a game for a couple days and throw it away. But this, I haven‚Äôt played a game this much since Divinity II and Ark.

11,KingVII412,"Genshin impact is a great game. very fun to play, engaging story, and aside from being a BoW clone it has an element of uniqueness to it. Over all a great game, but just not quite there on mobile. Has a lot of lag, but on top of that doesn‚Äôt provide the must haves for mobile gaming. The game doesn‚Äôt provide an option to rearrange ur hub layout, which is super surprising Bc this is a simple service that is provided by almost all newer mobile games. The game isn‚Äôt claw sensitive, for example if ur using an archer and you do an aimed shot, the game doesn‚Äôt allow u to hold the shoot bottom with one finger and aim with another which is really annoying. It‚Äôs not always a problem but it definitely get in the way. The game also isn‚Äôt compatible with a controller which is also surprising. It‚Äôs seems like the games has an obsolete approach to mobile gaming which is weird Bc the game legit just came out. Aside from the hiccups it‚Äôs a great game, just a way better game on every other platform. Take for example Fortnite mobile, epic was able to take the experience players had on pc and console and give it to mobile players. To the point where some mobile players were able to out preform some console players. That‚Äôs was amazing on epics part.

Overall this game is good but needs some fixes. Also I have a question for the developers : Will you guys bring back any banners like Venti‚Äôs banned or when Klee‚Äôs banner ends will you bring it back? Lastly my last change I would like to make is primogems and characters. Primogems are hard for me to get as a F2P. ( free to play ) Especially during this time school has started for many of the children. Like me I can only play for about 2-4 hours on weekdays and 4-6 ours on weekends and I play every other day. I think the primogems need to be able to claim 1600 within maybe 9 hours. For example you can send us more gifts in our mail or maybe 5 primogems for common chest, 10 for exquisite chest and 20 for precious chest. Now the characters, these characters are stunning you guys deserve a pat on the back. I feel like there is room for more but it might just be me becuase I hardly have any characters.

13,Allywocket,"One word: graphics
This game is absolutely beautiful! If you don‚Äôt actually like playing it, just use it as a 3D pose reference honestly. It‚Äôs a secret tool for any artist. Anyway, putting the amazing visuals aside, the gameplay is very fun, and also addicting. It so hard to find a decent open world game, so I was really excited when I got the ads. To be honest the ads don‚Äôt really do the game justice. I downloaded it under the impression that the combat portion would be lame. I thought you would only be able to view it from 1 POV, specifically from above. I had thought that the combat would be more like other combat heavy games, where you can‚Äôt exactly mover around freely, or just avoid conflict. When I downloaded it I completely believed that I would‚Äôve deleted it within 3 days. However, I can now confirm that this is one of my favorite games. I would recommend this to anyone that appreciates animation, loves orchestra music, or just likes the open world concept. Not to mention how cool the fighting animations are, and how diverse each character is. From outfits, to different skills, you can tell the devs put a lot of work into every detail. I haven‚Äôt yet unlocked the multiplayer mode, but I‚Äôm very much excited to try it out.

14,pocketilandtv,"-Opinions out of the way I love the game, I believe it to be a very good Free to Play game. Especially as a Free to Play mobile game, *cough* PC is better.

-Honestly if you seen Free to Play games out there they are always ‚Äúcopies‚Äù or just plain ripoff of other games. For instance, PUBG and Fornite, Overwatch and Paladins, and many more. People tend to side with games that they played first and hate the others. An I do see that many of the stuff from Breath of the Wild is being copied in this game. 
-Ok for those who complain about the gacha rates, you obviously haven‚Äôt played any gacha games or maybe you just have bad luck. Also it‚Äôs a Free to Play game made in Asia, what do you expect. If you can‚Äôt be a whale, flop! 
-Can‚Äôt really say much on the overhype thing, I too get that feeling with other games sometimes. All I can really say is to play it and find out, like just play ‚ÄúFree to Play‚Äù for like a good amount of time to see if you like it and if not then that‚Äôs ok.

The game is beautiful, the music is spectacular, the acting is decent, the game has interesting systems and mechanics, has interesting and highly customizable equipment/stats and has a great curve for learning to build and balance a party. The exploration is amazing and rewards you for paying attention to your surroundings. Sometimes the tangible rewards are lacking in uniqueness, but the feeling of solving the puzzle or finding a random boss fight is great. I hope for true boss encounters in the future and larger dungeons, but this is a game I will be coming back to for years.
The whole story can be beaten with free characters and items, and a decent amount of premium currency is given for playing the game to allow you to acquire a few more characters. If you want to get into the optional content most is possible for free, but paying allows you to have more fun and a more tailored party with better synergy. Seeing my first 5-star character‚Äôs ultimate ability for the first time was amazing. It felt like I was setting the whole battlefield on fire. That said, it is a long and involved game and can feel somewhat daunting.

The fact that you can have a party of four, with each member having unique elemental skills and weapons specialties for whatever puzzles and enemies come your way.

And while the game‚Äôs PS4 counterpart lacks cross-save compatibility, it might prove useful to content creators who wish to do a Let‚Äôs Play of Genshin Impact.

That said, I gave this game four stars. The reason for this isn‚Äôt because of some minor glitches that allow items to just float in midair (like what happened to me lol), but because of overheating issues on my IPhone SE Second Generation and the amount of battery life it siphons compared to some of my other apps. For mobile users such as myself, this game could definitely use a Battery Saver feature in the options menu. Could help with the battery issues, especially since once it overheats to a certain extent, the phone can lose charge... while it‚Äôs charging.

The story, animation style, battle tactics, monsters, and characters are all lovable and delightful! It feels like being in a movie or playing one of my Xbox games. Really well done to the creators. So far, my favorite character is Lisa for both her charm and powerful lighting strikes during combat. Keep up the great work! I would like to suggest the ability to possibly change clothing on characters as well so that it feels more personalized if that‚Äôs alright. One downside I will note is having to walk everywhere and how gliding takes up physical energy. I can understand swimming and such, but gliding? Yeah right. Anyway, walking around to different locations without having something shoot at or lunge at you is a bit much. Overall, I still enjoy it despite the walking aspects. Perhaps you guys could create different elemental mounts? Like not your traditional horses and stuff. I‚Äôm talking about like birds, lions, or unique creatures like that.

Then Genshin Impact came. Patiently day after day I would wait eagerly for the game to launch after seeing it appear on the App Store. While the download did take a little while in the beginning, the wait was more than worth it. The game is just absolutely beautiful, from the environment to the designs of the characters them selves. The game brings you in to another world full of color and adventure. The music is soothing to the ears as I walk the lands of Teyvat moving from quest to quest or finding a monster to beat. The game is smooth when it comes to combat controls and the layout of everything in general is very appealing, not like other games full to the brim with buttons and menus. This game reminds me of The Legend Of Zelda : Breath Of The Wild. (For those who have played it would see what I mean haha). The only con I can see with this game is that my phone overheats a bit. Overall I can‚Äôt wait to see what you guys have in store for us players. If you‚Äôre still reading this quit right now and get this game. You will not be disappointed.

22,Someone who lov,"I first want to state that the game itself is a very well made and well thought out game. It can get you addicted within the hour of playing it. I really enjoy getting the story quests and all the other small minor things in the game that make it that much more interesting. It has so many amazing features to it and when you first start playing it and getting used to the story, side quests, and things you have to do to progress is really amazing.

Once you get farther into the game (adventure rank 25 and further) it gets much harder to progress in the game and harder to level up the adventure rank further. You need your adventure rank a certain rank to actually get the next story quest. This leads to 20 hours of grinding to level up just to get 20 or so minutes of a story. Making it easier to level up in the game would make the game much more enjoyable and interesting because you have something to look forward to instead of dreading the hours of grinding needed to level up a few times to get farther into the story. I‚Äôm a mobile player and I also would like if there were to be a battery saver on it so my phone would not always be on 20%.",5,"Amazing, even better with some work.",2020-10-25 03:38:50,False
23,no nicknames avalobale,"When I saw other people playing the game and say how cool everything was, how the graphics are amazing, the story is engaging, when I got the game I was excited. But when I actually opened it the screen was black. So I thought that this is just the opening screen but when I started to play, everything around me was black and I can only see a certain section of where I was. It made me really uncomfortable and I felt pain that I couldn‚Äôt play the game. I had really high hopes to be able to play it but I couldn‚Äôt. So since I wanted to play it I continued to but when I got to the part where I got sucked up in the tornado and had to fight the dragon, that‚Äôs where I gave up because my whole screen was just black and I couldn‚Äôt do anything. So when I went to the app on the App Store I saw that you would have to have the iPhone 8 or up, I got kinda mad because not everyone is able to get the newest phone. Some people don‚Äôt have that kind of money (like me). So the MAIN BIGGEST thing you can do is to let the game be playable on all mobile devices so that way everyone can be happy and play. I know this game is new and all and you guys have a lot of reviews but I think this is a main one to do or at least think about. Hope you guys see this review and react to this. üòä

25,yayo35,"This game is absolutely beautiful. The animators definitely spent a great deal of care and time in bringing this game to life. The aesthetics of the world and everything within is outright amazing! The characters and NPCs all are unique as well. I spent so much time just exploring the rather large area of the world right out of the gate rather than jumping into the story line. To everybody that‚Äôs thinking of doing the same, as it is quiet fun to do, I recommend at least going along and getting your wings and first couple team mates before you do begin to adventure around. Just need a few of those perks in order to complete a number of.... well I‚Äôll say encounters so as not to spoil anything. This is in my opinion the perfect open world game for mobile. But with all the praise there is also a downside; this game is an absolute monster on battery life. Make sure you have a power source nearby if you want to dive into this world. Trust me, if you start roaming around, time and battery life will go before you even realize how long it‚Äôs been. 

Would recommend the developers to include a battery icon and clock visual in game so players can monitor both as they play. Otherwise this is a perfect game to me.",5,Well worth your time!,2020-10-08 22:44:14,False
26,Immortal panda,"Really have been enjoying my time with this game the world is absolutely stunning, the dialogue I find to be quite humorous and the gameplay is overall really fun. I especially love the way the elements will interact with each other adding another layer of thought behind party builds. However this game is very very very very greedy surprisingly for a mostly single player rpg with very limited co-op. The rates for the gacha are actually absurd the rate for a 5* character/weapon is a measly 0.6% which would be acceptable if you didn‚Äôt have to get a character 7 times to actually fully unlock their constellations(abilities,talents, passives etc.) as well as the 0.6% being split between characters and weapons so realistically there‚Äôs a 0.3% chance of pulling a 5* character and 0.3% for a 5* weapon; so unless you have 10‚Äôs of thousands of dollars to spend on the game to actually get the characters you want your best bet is to be f2p and just go for 4* characters that way you may be able to unlock there full potential (constellations)
Hopefully that will be addressed considering the recuperated the development cost in 1 week of the game being out.

27,Cindy pho,"I wrote a review last time, telling you my issues with this game and random bugs. I was able to get that fixed, my solution was to reinstall the app, but with this glitch I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. For one, it kicks me out a lot, which is expected from a really high quality game, but not this much. How the ‚Äúgetting kicked out system‚Äù works (Or for what I found out) is that for however long I don‚Äôt play, that time will affect how long I can stay in the game for. So if I don‚Äôt play for about 2 days or so, that would be like 2 hours of free playtime, then I‚Äôll get kicked, then my playtime decreases every time. This is weird for me because I haven‚Äôt seen my friends ever complain about this before. Another glitch is that some times when I wanna play Genshin impact, it just keeps me at a white screen for a couple of minutes, until it kicks me out of the app. Mainly the biggest issue is the first complaint, but the second one might become a issue if it keeps doing that.

28,Reds Honest Review,Ok.. so we all know there is some cons to every pro in gaming. Well it‚Äôs basically a Japanese gotcha game. You don‚Äôt have to throw money at it but you can be rewarded for everything in the game which is slower. But the real reason for this review is the combat.. it‚Äôs amazing! Four party members to rotate in combat and different elements to play mix and match with. You can go for pyro-electro for explosions for massive AOE damage. There is an element to every character and they transfer to the next chosen character in battle. The targeting is pretty spot on to. Most games have this weird tap to cycle target but this one doesn‚Äôt. It lets you do everything on your own. The biggest con that this game has to begin with is grouping with your friends. The game doesn‚Äôt allow you to group till adventure level 15 (not character level 15). When you are able to get with your friends man it is so much fun cause the mix and match of elements is pretty crazy for the amount of things going on in the background. I give this game an honest 8/10.. The reason for is the gotcha system to pay to get ahead is a gimmick.. but other than that it‚Äôs super fun and would highly recommend to anyone and it‚Äôs free to play.,5,The combat is awesome!,2020-11-02 21:17:13,False
29,bestf(wen),"Genshin Impact is a fantastic game.  From the get go, its absolutely beautiful and the attention to detail in each and every frame and background is astounding.  The story is captivating and every quest is interesting and not boring at all.  It definitely is a game that will keep you wanting to play more and more.  The way that the game changes weather and time is also beautiful as well.  I‚Äôve watched sunrises, sunsets, battled in the rain, fought numerous amounts of monsters, all within a MOBILE game.  The game is such an amazing mobile game that it feels like you‚Äôre playing on an actual console (or on the computer).  Paimon is definitely the most annoying character out there and RNG is the worst way to try and get characters ever because I have terrible luck BUT EVEN SO, the game is so much fun to play you will have trouble putting it down.  Each character also has unique abilities and there is so much to learn in this game.  Definitely would recommend and I‚Äôve had the most fun playing this game over all other games that I have ever played on a mobile phone.  Hands down, if I could give it 10/5 stars, I would.

30,MeowBob,"First, let me just say this game is absolutely fantastic and fun to play...for a week or so. Once you hit around Adventure Rank 30 you will become gated so hard by the resin (energy) system that you can only play for 30-60min a day with meaningful progression. Resin refreshes at a rate of 1/8min so you can regenerate 180 resin per day. All content that you need to grind (Mora [in game currency], character exp, weapon enhancement mats, skill enhancement books, world bosses, weekly bosses, equipment dungeons, etc) costs 20-60 resin each! Be careful spending money in this game because they have cleverly hidden this restriction since you can play an unlimited amount through exploring the map in the early game. It will not become apparent how painfully limiting this energy system is until you have finished the current main storyline (AR30). If you are an extremely casual player who can only play an hour a day, then yes you will be able to enjoy the game for quite some time. But if you are gamer that loves to progress as much as possible and level up all your characters then you will hit a brick wall. Even if you spend money to refresh your resin, your money will only net you a few extra minutes of playtime. One star until the devs fix their energy system and actually allow people to play their game without having to spend hundreds of $$$.

Im amazed that there can be a mobile game this good, but Im disappointed that on the ipad I played on, brand new by the way, without anything on it, deleted all photos and all other games, I was still kicked out every 5-10 minutes. I couldnt actually gain progress because it wouldnt save the things i did in simply 5 minutes, which is reasonable, but I dont think thats a problem I should have to worry about. Then, I tried to play on my iphone 7 to find it doesnt show water or sky, its black, and you can only see a half a chunk away. Of course, this is only for iphone 8s or lower, as it says in the game description. My problem with that is I dont understand why that would happen?? Iphone 7 or 6 is a phone i see a lot of people owning so its disappointing that it means a lot of iphone users cant play.

It is absolutely so fun, and there is so much to do when it comes to both main and side quests. It is an open world type game, so look for hidden gems and chests, too! Just exploring is beautiful and all the stories somehow fit together. Ranking up is fairly easy, but it still can be a bit of a challenge, which is great. You don't want something you can just blow through. They have great in-game shops where you can spend coins you find from just exploring. Hardly would you have to ever actually use real currency to play or profess, which in itself is amazing! The voice overs and the characters you can both earn, and win through Wishes are so great, and some of them are so adorable lol. I've already found quite a few I favor. This game is great to pass time and I highly recommend it simply because it's relaxing, yet has a lot of combat, exploration and just all around goofy fun, too.

First, about monetization, it is absolutely fine to expect making a lot of money from this game consider the development cost and everything. However, one thing this game does not differ from many other Chinese games is a hard effort cap in gaining characters. I have played effortlessly on gaining in-game currencies but I would say it at maximum gives one draw each hour of gameplay. With a 0.6% chance, you barely gain any 5 star characters by only playing. Before the game launches, I was honestly expecting to see more monetization options on skins and other customizations, instead of on characters.
Second, about protagonist gameplay, personally I would like the protagonist ‚Äútraveler‚Äù to have more weapon options, the ability to wield two elements at the same time, and cross-element skills.
Third, vehicle, bike, horse, or anything. :)

They‚Äôve put their desire for money over the enjoyment players get from the game. This stems from their creation of the resin system. 120 resin with world events costing 20, world bosses costing 40 and stage bosses costing 60. There is no way to increase this cap, increasing AR does not refill it meaning you‚Äôd have to burn your refills (which only give back 60) or pay money to refill. If not, you‚Äôll be waiting 15 hours to get meaningful play out of the game again. Premium currency dries up quickly, the coop is largely irrelevant because all content practically vanishes when you enter someone‚Äôs world. They have one again set up a sorry excuse for a pull system, that could very well require a duo pity system as they try to milk the willing, and the fact they made here heroes limited and largely pivotal due to element is a big tempting grab at your money.

The company that makes it is very anti-consumer to the point it puts EA to shame with their monetization practices. For people who are not familiar with Gacha, it's a basically an anime casino where you have to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars in a slot machine to get a playable character or weapon for the game. You can't even choose what you want, it's all random. You can spend 300$ and not get the character you want. 

Let's say you actually got lucky and got a character you want, you can't even level up this character at all. In order to get materials and money to level up your character you need to go on dungeons and the game only allows you to do 6 of them per day. The only thing you can do is free roam and do nothing at all in the game if you do your 6 dungeons a day. You can choose to do 3 bosses instead of the 6 dungeons and thats it. 

Please do not download this game, it's a complete waste of time and money. It encourages gambling and addiction and gives nothing back.

If you are a person who gets dedicated to a game and wants to grind, this game might be too much you. The amount of investment to level a single character to maximum level will literally take months of daily grinding using the little bit of Resin they give you. The worst part of it all is it seems the developers realize this and refuse to change their flawed system that they have implemented on their players. The response to us not having enough Resin was met with an increased cap of Resin... but that doesn‚Äôt fix how long it takes to refill? Even without the Resin issue there still character tomes (xp) Imbalance issues, Mora income imbalance issues, heck even basic character xp issues from combat.

At first I had trouble loading the beginning cut scenes, but after that, I never had trouble with lag our audio glitches. The visuals are bright and beautiful, much better than most games out there currently. Now as for the gameplay itself, I am a newbie to this game, but it focuses mostly on grinding levels for many different characters and completing many different quests across the large world map. I love running across the map and not having to stop for any loading screens, it‚Äôs all one big world!

Now there is something for the developers to work on, as this is rated four stars and not five. As in many other reviews, there are many, many times where I will just be playing and either the screen will freeze or the game will completely crash. That gets quite annoying. 

Now I do understand that this is only the second day off of launch, so I will give them grace... hopefully they can fix the crashing issue, then I will rate it 5 stars!",4,Really good just lots of crashes.,2020-09-28 19:06:55,False
46,Zaytune_1,This is one of the best games I‚Äôve played in years. Yesterday I spent almost 8 hours playing. I starting reading the reviews and saw a minor trend. Some people were saying they experienced graphic and audio lag and black spots. I‚Äôm using the iPhone 11 Pro Max and experience no issues. It‚Äôs the most graphically stunning game I‚Äôve ever played on a phone. So if you if don‚Äôt have some power under the hood of your phone it may be difficult for you. With that being said this game is so refreshing. It breaks the static mold of mobile gaming today. It‚Äôs so underwhelming playing the same card based energy consumption model over and over that unoriginal developers have been using for years. Baffling how they seem to believe that we enjoy our games all playing the same with the same inherent limitations. Surely they must play games themselves. With the power that phones and tablets can come with today finally a developer has started utilizing it. Hopefully this is a turning point and other developers will see this creating a new model for mobil gaming. Thank you miHoYo for this epic creation!,5,Epic...Better than most console games,2020-10-12 14:21:17,False
47,MoonCake ‚ú®,"Overall, I‚Äôm very impressed with the quality of this game. The graphics are so beautiful, and it is very aesthetically pleasing whenever I play. There is a bunch of cool characters and an amazing storyline to play through. When I first downloaded Genshin Impact I was skeptical, and didn‚Äôt really know what it was. Now, after only a few days of playing, I am officially addicted. You can explore the map, battle monsters, collect cute, new characters, and complete quests to progress in the story. I am absolutely in love! However, there are a few small mistakes that the creators may have overlooked. At one point while summoning Dvalin, Paimon was talking to Lumine about her sister, when Lumine only has a twin brother. The game must‚Äôve thought that I was playing as the brother, but I wasn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs about the only mistake I‚Äôve found in the game, just pronouns. Otherwise everything seems perfect! I notice that the creators are frequently updating the game, which is always great to see. This game is by far my favorite RPG, and I would definitely recommend playing it. Thank you for creating this masterpiece! üíó",5,Amazing game!!!,2020-11-07 09:09:32,False
48,hisuetohno,Is really laggy and glitchy on the iPhone 7 like ik they recommend a iPhone 8 Plus but still can they at least add some kind of like settings menu to lower the graphics to make it run better or at least make it soo it doesn‚Äôt take soo much ram like the A10 still is capable of running good looking games if optimized correctly also I have a friend with a iPhone 11 and the game also lags there and even crashes soo I think there is some kind of optimization problem with it but yea great game the iPhone version needs some fixing I guess I‚Äôll stick to my ps4 until I get a switch or it gets fixed for iOS I really did make a mistake getting a 1299 dollars monster pc instead of taking a switch and saving some for the iPhone 12 whenever it comes out and getting more simple pc because to be honest my pc is way too overkill for the games I play I got too hyped with this rtx 3080 I should have taken a rtx 2060 instead anyways ik this probably will no get attention by the devs but if it doesn‚Äôt please add a settings menu or make some extra optimizations to it if possible,5,I love the game but,2020-10-15 00:43:18,False

The game is like every anime game plus Sky children of the light and many others added together to make one awesome adventure. If you can‚Äôt get ahold of me, assume I‚Äôm playing this. Update: I have been playing for weeks now maybe a month. Currently I‚Äôm world level 3 at level 31, it is now laggy and harder to play. My character makes mistakes and the gameplay is harder. I wish there was more time to level up character before the bosses get stronger at each world level. It‚Äôs hard to use my characters when the bosses keep getting harder to fight. I have focused on Barbra and the Chinese girl that I forgot the name of. The gatcha system is too expensive. I still don‚Äôt have a level 5 character which is okay. I just need the lag to go away.

For now we only care of 'elements' and once we got the good gears we just spam the attck button and this will finish the boss, no thinking needed. Pls make it so we need to use various of heros combinations. This will be much more entertaining than focus on fighting the same dungion over and over (which the current game flow focus on). To be able to do this, your abyss will need to have different bosses than just a bigger 'slimes'. Moreover, The current game make it impossible to fully lvl up more than 2 dps to 90 bc the lack of resources. This defeat the purpose of wanting to summon for more characters since I cannot do anything with them, there are no way for my new chars to catch up with my current lvl. Ppl are paying alot on the summon, not the resin, so putting a heavy pay gate on the resin only gonna kill off the game and make the game repetitive!

I mean yes the combat system is by far one of the best that I have encountered not only amongst RPG genre but for many other combat involved games as well, Genshin Impact takes the cake! My only suggestion as for something to make the experience even better, would be controller support. I‚Äôm sure you folks down in development have heard this a million times over, but please would you consider at least adding it for a short time and letting us, the players, decide if we like it or not. There are many of us who prefer mobile or can‚Äôt afford consoles so for you to make this one a mobile was a huge one up for the mobile community.

53,Def not a robot7777777,"Still not sure how they made this a mobile game. Pretty much a free to play breath of the wild. The graphics are breathtaking and somehow the game still runs really well on my iPhone 8plus. The world is huge and being added to as I am writing this review. There is so many small side quests, puzzles, and objectives. The world is well done and the small treasures you find just feeds your brain dopamine and you can‚Äôt stop. The main story itself is alright with nice animations and cut Scenes. The game play itself is also really fun with a pretty neat combat system.

There are some downside with this game. If you binge play this game (like 40hr/week) you will likely run out of things to do within 2-3 weeks and then have to wait for the new map expansion. There will still be things to do during that time but definitely not enough to keep you playing at your 40 hour/ week  pace. But if you take things slow and investigate/explore the world as you slowly progress the main story and not rush and binge play you will have high quality entertainment for a long time.",5,Best mobile game in a while,2020-10-17 20:22:50,False
54,sunnydrizzle,"A great game that seems to be easily able to expand on content over time. The combat is extremely fun and dynamic. Finding gear for your character is random, but with it comes a great feeling when you finally get the one you want. The world is gorgeous and filled up with things to grab/fight!  

I give the game 4 stars because the resin/primogem system rewards you with a ton of items at the start, but takes that level of reward away over time like a shady drug dealer. The rates for characters are awful given the price point for a shot at them, especially after you‚Äôve spent money on the one time bonus gems packs. The more they add characters, the less likely you get the one that would fit perfectly in your team so that leaves me worried about the future of the game. I‚Äôm also going to be keeping a close eye on balance in the game. I want my money spent now on the game to be just as worth it if I had saved it till next year. Please value our spending on your game. 

I see myself having a lot more fun with the game and look forward to challenging content in the future. PLEASE INCREASE G√ÇCHA RATES AND RESIN CAP/RECHARGE. Thank you <3",4,A couple changes and it‚Äôs a must play,2020-10-08 03:52:17,False
55,Rohan6144,I know there‚Äôs more content coming out which is great but once you finish the story so far the games true character comes out. It‚Äôs nothing but a cash grab. Once you have beaten the story everything left to requires money to do. Console quality graphics and story. Mobile game mechanics and monetization.  This game is a gacha game meaning there‚Äôs a gambling element to it. For characters and weapons. Compares to other games in this category the rates for pulling characters and weapons are FAR lower than other games and the cost for pulling is twice as much as most other games. Character progression is gated behind an energy system on top of a grinding system. Most other games of this type are far more generous with their energy system.  It gets worse. You can spend hundreds trying to get a specific top tier character you want but only to realize that the character is in balanced to the point where he is out classed by mid tier characters. Once the entire players base is up in arms about this the developer responds basically with ‚Äúlol git gud‚Äù. So my advice for everyone is enjoy the game for what it is. Take your time to go through the story and don‚Äôt spend a single time. Use the free rolls you earn and don‚Äôt spend another time trying to pull anything else. It‚Äôs just not worth it.,1,Great starting out. Terrible endgame.,2020-12-07 21:48:54,False
56,founderofseals,"Fun and full of adventure. Genshin Impact is a RPG game. It has an anime style with beautiful scenes. You fight monsters and there's lots of characters you could get. Some are stronger than the others. They are marked by star ranking and colors. Purple is really good, blue is ok. Its Free and fun to play. My personal feelings for it is that I love the action but there's a lot of talking. Sometimes I just skip throws and hope for the best. The more you play the more you level up. The more you level up the more stuff you unlock and gain to upgrade your character and the weapons for your character. This Game reminds me of an anime I watched a long time ago. Sword Art Online. It's almost the same. Except in Genshin it's not Vr and there's not that many monster variations and you are not able to create your own character. What I like about Genshin is that it's a free map. You have missions to accomplish but it doesn't force you to complete them automatically. You can be given a mission and then do whatever you want. You can either explore the world and hunt and cook or you can carry on with the mission.",5,amazing,2020-11-13 17:19:17,False

Sure there are mechanics like climbing and use of a glider, gathering materials spread through out the over world, and the general environmental design and look similarities. But due to the combat and now the narrative is progressed, it‚Äôs a far different experience. It‚Äôs has taken good aspects of BotW and established it‚Äôs own game, I consider this to be a homage with extreme similarities than just a knock off trying to piggy back on BotW popularity and polish. I myself brushed it off as a BotW copy cat, but I was very surprised to be wrong about that. Now I hope the gacha mechanic doesn‚Äôt sour the overall experience and make it worth while for free to play players. Though like Arknights, I hope this game becomes something the player wants to put in their own hard earned money due to how well made this game might be.

It‚Äôs free on all platforms and has cross save, so it‚Äôs great on the go or at home. One issue though, resin. Resin is an awful system. You get limited amounts a day then you have to wait hours for it to restore. Resin is used for almost everything you grind, money key limes, exp key limes, domains, events. For all the things you can do with it you don‚Äôt have near enough of it. After you do the main story the game relies on you to grind your characters up, and get new ones to incentivize playing but you can‚Äôt for more than an hour because the resin system prevents long term gains. You should add a system where you can stack resin if you‚Äôre not using it, or increase the cap. Anything to make resin a resource that drains less quick. I want to spend hours grinding on your game but the resin system prevents that. Though that being said, there is a lot of things that don‚Äôt use resin such as side quests, main quests, and exploring so it‚Äôs still a great game despite this system.",4,"Great game, mediocre system.",2020-10-13 15:27:23,False

However,  I‚Äôm not fond of how because I didn‚Äôt select the female character the voices of the characters I interact with don‚Äôt follow the dialogue of the game captions so I‚Äôll hear them calling me a girl or hear them say ‚Äúhope you find your brother‚Äù but when I read the dialogue I‚Äôll be reading the opposite.

That‚Äôs just an insane little detail that I appreciate. There‚Äôs also so many hidden secrets and Easter eggs that are so amazing too! Basically this game is so worth it.

This game is a true open world game which is rare in games nowadays, with the amazing storyline and side quests. If I had any complaint about it, it would be about the fact that after level 20 leveling up gets increasingly difficult, repetitive and time consuming. Most side quests have to be found by just walking around I would like it more if you added more features to the map like possible side quests or explorable areas for more experience points to help with leveling. I also feel like there should be more mobs it gets a little repetitive fighting the same kinds on repeat though I understand since the game is fairly new.

One of them is the immense crashing. Every 5-15 minutes, the game crashes and it's getting really annoying. If it helps, sometimes I see red or green lines on the buildings before the game crashes. Another problem is the battery usage. Only this game drains too much of my battery and sometimes my iPad starts overheating. I've checked the other apps ands it's only this game that's causing the problem. Also, the enemy spawns sometimes takes way too long. For example, there's this quest where you have to unlock a tri-seal. The Meaty tribe has this sort of challenge and you get 1 minute and 35 seconds to defeat 10 enemies. The problem is, the enemies take too long to spawn and the result is 50 seconds of battle time.

However, once you get past the honeymoon phase of the first 20-30 hours, you will start to realize that miHoYo designed the game in a way that limits the player‚Äôs progression in every single way possible. From the smallest thing such as crafting ores to level up your weapons to spending resin for running dungeons and bosses to get ascension materials. They limit it all. It‚Äôs like they are trying their best to prevent players from progression in an OPEN WORLD game. Some might argue that the game is design as a mobile game. The funny thing is that playing on mobile is the hardest compared to playing on PS4 or PC. Furthermore, I have never seen a greedier company than miHoYo. They made $100 million (their entire production cost) in the first 2 weeks, yet they don‚Äôt have any sort of daily login rewards outside of the initial 7 days and when they do send out codes for rewards or host events they give you crumbs - not even enough for a single gacha pull.

Fourth THIS WILL BE GRINDY I played in the beta, and most other players will agree, it takes time and many resources to build teams, and I specifically said it with a plural word. Fifth, YOU WILL NEED MULTIPLE UNITS for end game since dungeons have different effects which will benefit specific characters. I think I mentioned most of the things that WILL RUIN most people‚Äôs experience, now for the good stuff.

73,Trearel,"First off, I haven‚Äôt played the game too much, but from what I have played and continue to play the game is just amazing, the graphics, frame rate and dialogue are truly top notch. And with elements like the open world and polished combat you are sure to have loads of fun! I also want to address the negative reviews, pretty much ignore almost all of them, those reviews are mainly talking about how the game wont open or doesn‚Äôt have controller support. To that I would, chill out. The game has been out for like 2 days and I experienced the same issue with logging in, but after a little while I was able to get in and start playing. It makes no sense to me when people rate a games quality based on the fact they couldn‚Äôt get into it. I understand it‚Äôs frustrating, but that‚Äôs kind of a weird thing to give the game a 1 star when you literally just need to wait a small amount to play.

74,Resheram7777,"So I am officially addicted to this game. So much replay ability is very good in a game and this game feels like it should cost money, and deserves a 5 star review. However, as with many games, there is also a problem. The problem with this one is that it fails to run well on lower end devices. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am still addicted to this game. The constant crashes and massive lag spikes don‚Äôt deplete that much from the game itself, as they barely ever screw you over. I wasn‚Äôt actually going to write a review, until the lag spikes interrupted my gameplay. At the Luhua Pool, there is a quest where you have to help a man find his art supplies. However, my lag spike did not load that character. Or the door to the temple. Seeing as there was no door, I walked into the temple, without doing the quest and a supreme lack of oversight. I claimed the chests when they loaded and teleported out. Now I attempted the quest just because I need XP. So here I am, an idiot who opened a door with no chests. So now I can‚Äôt complete the quest. Thanks, game.

This is one of few times the gatcha system didnt dissuade me from playing.

To top it all off, the game is cross-compatible w/ ps4, pc, mobile; cross-save for mobile & pc, & a tba switch date!

I could go on about how astounded i am by this game & i recommend to anyone who enjoys PvE & multiplayer.

76,Cindehhh,"Alright, this has got to be the BEST game I‚Äôve ever played on my phone. It‚Äôs incredibly immersive, expansive and so finely-detailed for a game that‚Äôs adapted to the iPhone. It‚Äôs like playing an actual console game on your phone. No lagging, no annoying ads to watch or skip, no required in-app purchases or pay-to-play/win nonsense. It‚Äôs got a Zelda BotW vibe, mixed-in with maybe some Kingdom Hearts/Final Fantasy elements. 

The developers put so much detail in the game, and it shows. There‚Äôs voiceovers, a free-roam environment to explore, tons of quests to complete, etc. Honestly, I‚Äôm blown away that this game is free. Games like this is so rare nowadays, where develop quality games for others to enjoy first and foremost, and cashing in on the game from it being less of an emphasis. Not saying we all deserve free games, but it‚Äôs easy to see how money-hungry game developers are nowadays, and are willing to churn out a mediocre game year after year for the sake of money, and expecting people to pay top dollar for them.

79,TiuMars redux,"I do really like this game. The art style combined with solid mechanics and an interesting story make it worth playing alone. That said, there are things that do need to be fixed. Early on they throw a lot of free stuff at you (as most f2p games do) and there is a decent amount of content to keep you occupied. The problems start once you hit adventure rank 20 or so. After awhile the game literally becomes pay to play. You have the energy to do a max of 6 missions (depending on the mission, could be as low as 2.) you are basically given a choice, save the daily gems you get to do a free 10 summon once a month, or use them to get more energy so you're able to upgrade and level up characters and gear. Despite this I do really enjoy the game and will continue to play, but if the current resin system doesn't change or they don't add other free ways to just play the game then I will be abandoning the game.

The gameplay is pretty good and simple, the music is nice and fitting, the graphics are great for a mobile game, I like the anime aesthetic, the voice actors are good(at least the japanese ones), and open world games like this are my favorite. It feels like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but with magic. The story is relatively engaging and there are mechanics that make it feel like a survival game, like cooking, climbing and hunting. Some downsides I can think of are that the game is really big. Right now, it‚Äôs sitting at 7.12 GB of storage and took around half a day to download. Another downside is the rarity of the good characters. I have pulled quite a few times so far (around 30-40 times) and have gotten no characters, only items. And the last downside I can think of is that sometimes when alot is going on, the FPS drops like crazy, but that‚Äôs expected for such a big game.

81,CyrusNyx,"This game is great. I like it a lot and I can do almost every quest, there is one quest that is extremely hard to do in mobile. It‚Äôs the search the vault/protect the cache, the first round to fighting off one mecha/ruin guard and then you live on to defeating 3 at the same time. If the cache still has some percentage left and you beat the 3, you then have to fight the ruin hunter. Unlike another quest where you‚Äôre surrounded by water that you/your enemies can drown in this only has water where you can freeze your enemies and it only sometimes works. I‚Äôve found a few quests to be difficult but this is by far the hardest. I have gone to tutorials and even those in the comments also say that it‚Äôs is extremely difficult on mobile.

82,YourHusbando,This game compared to mobile games is definitely a must have. It being a open world breath of the wild style game. Exploring and grinding quite fun. The story while so far nothing spectacular is fun. The only two things that brings this game down a little. Is the gatcha system and rates. While free I wish they did things like separate the weapons from the character banner. Do what epic seven and allow multiple rerolls. So you don‚Äôt have to make a new account. Plus that would stop people selling accounts. Another thing is for people that aren‚Äôt used to gatcha game or rusty. Give them some more tips like focusing on two dps rather than the whole team. Had to start over cause I had to much fun and spread my resources thin. Trying out all the new units. Still for a mobile game this is the best of its kind. It‚Äôs about as good breath of the wild a fun but flawed game in iteself. So yeah I recommend it...... though devs can you please stop giving me 5 star weapons and just give me a five star character instead. XD,5,Great game but,2020-10-12 18:16:57,False
83,Akirri,"I‚Äôve been poking at Genshin Impact the last couple of days. I love the graphics! The character system is really fun too. I love being able to swap between the main character and others to combine elemental powers and find new ways to take down enemies. Being able to climb every where and glide is a lot of fun too. However I will say the mobile controls are a little annoying at times. 

I love that you can summon more heroes to fill out your team. It‚Äôs tempting to use real money to keep pulling for a hero, however it‚Äôs nice that you can earn in game currency to do the same. I look forward to seeing what new heroes they bring to the game.

I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything that suggest this game can use a controller. I play on an iPad Pro and have a lot of space to navigate, but I find when running around the world it‚Äôs hard to pan the camera around with out hitting other abilities or sometimes my thumb doesn‚Äôt register when I‚Äôm tapping on powers to activate.

Have no fear just buy the monthly pass or spend money on a battle pass you might say? Both of these things don‚Äôt actually compensate you with progress within the game or speed up the character progression system. Even if you do end up pulling a 5* character later the resources needed to max them out make it feel like less of a good thing and more of a sinking dread of choosing between progressing and gearing or wasting thousands of resin leveling up a new character. 

Mihoyo is this game a collectors game or not? What‚Äôs the reward in spending any money here. I‚Äôve never played a game where I‚Äôve spent so much and gotten so little, I understand there‚Äôs not a lot of content because it‚Äôs new but this monetization strategy might be successful initially but will drive off spenders like me because unless I keep spending I basically have to grind endlessly just to hit a pity banner.

I‚Äôve spent a good few hrs so far without getting bored. I also like how this game isn‚Äôt pay to play. The spawn rates aren‚Äôt that good but I can live with it. You can still progress in the game with the default characters. The game itself is great, but I do have some suggestions that I think will make the game even better:

- The ability to go into every building. While the towns are beautiful and big, I think it would be great being able to walk into houses and every business.
- Have more ways of healing. Cooking is great but maybe add an inn at each town? And also, have characters revive over time after getting defeated in battle? Or you can even add a feature where characters heal little by little whenever they sit.
- Have the npc conversations go back to where you left off prior to you selecting your reply. It‚Äôs kind of annoying having to go through all the dialogue in order to read the answer to every choice.

Like I said, the game is fun. The only real con I have is that the game overheats my phone and crashes at times. I usually have to play with my phone near a fan and plugged in to keep it cool and prevent the battery from draining. Other than that, you would not regret downloading the game!

What would be better is if the petrify was longer and the physical/geo damage buff it had in beta was added again. Please consider making some buffs to Zhong Li, he is my favorite character. Geo as an element overall could also use some changes to boost up damage. Zhong li as a shield user is an alright idea, but since the game is all about beating the clock and doing the most damage, having shields instead of a damage dealer is not the best.

Furthermore the currency to get drops without spending money can be obtained by opening chest, problem is you will most likely get 2 and 4 useless items. The stamina mechanic is unbalanced in my opinion the enemies could start rushing and shooting missiles at you but if your stamina is depleted your just going to have to hope that your character doesn't die which they most likely will.

Other features such as gliding and cooking will never not be fun to do.

The crashes can take place at the worst times, but they miraculously always start you back off only a few steps from where you were. 
Other than the lag and crashing, I have nothing but positive experiences playing this game. 
This game IS worth the hype.

EDIT: after about a week of playing, the crashing has almost completely stopped, though once in a blue moon does it happen again. The lag also becomes less common, though not to the same rate as the crashing. Lag occurs mostly in battle, and while it can get annoying, it‚Äôs understandable with all of the fire, magic, and claymores being thrown around.

The thing is, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to play. The cutscenes never work, the audio cuts in and out and my screen freezes. I tried closing it and opening the game again, but the cutscene just does the same thing, so I have to wait it out. As your traveling around, the graphics don‚Äôt load, so sometimes you have to interact with a character or something but you can‚Äôt since the graphics didn‚Äôt load. The only way for the graphics to appear is to close out the app and re open it. Sometimes when you interact with something or someone in the game, the game freezes, so you have to close out the app and reopen it. I don‚Äôt like having to reopen the app every few minutes. It gets quite annoying. It‚Äôs such a fantastic game, but these bugs are making it really hard for me to want to keep playing. Please fix these bugs, I love the game and don‚Äôt wanna give it up.

I do play over my iPhone 8 and it tends to have a heating problem, so I‚Äôve balanced this out with lower graphics, but the game crashes frequently and I‚Äôm unable to prevent it anymore than I already have.

This game is so beautiful, and the fact that I have my graphics all the way low and it still manages to run smoothly is unbelievable. What I also love about the game is by the fact that you can get a guaranteed 4 Star if you summon on a multi. This way when you summon, you won‚Äôt get fully shafted by only getting 3 stars.

Not only are the graphics and characters great, but the story keeps your interest. I can‚Äôt wait to see how far this game will come along!!

Couple suggestions though!!

Is it possible to have friends on other servers? I wasn‚Äôt able to locate one of them because he was in Europe, and I was in the American server. If not, definitely should be a thing! :)

Another thing that would be really neat is romancing characters in game! Going on dates and gifting them things.

Some other suggestions would be to make talking to friends more accessible, even if we‚Äôre not in co-op, it would be nice to talk to the ones online. 

I think the co-op mode definitely needs some tweaks, but it‚Äôs getting there. It‚Äôs not the greatest game for co-op, because there‚Äôs a lack of things your friends can do with you. We should be able to do more quests with them. It would also be nice to be able to have avatar emotes in game. 

Another thing I think could need updating, is the camera option. There‚Äôs a lack of poses and features for it, as a creative person, it would be nice to be able to take more photos of my game and with my friends!

107,ScarlettDare,"Genshin is fine. Aesthetic wise, it‚Äôs above almost every mobile game I‚Äôve played, and the first few hours are a blast. However, because it‚Äôs trying to be both a gatcha game and an open world game similar to others, it fails at both. It‚Äôs not good at being open world due to having to grind repeatedly, making the world feel less and less interesting by the day. And it‚Äôs not a good gatcha game by making it not worth paying under hundreds of dollars. But the biggest problem with genshin impact is how it punishes you. If you play through the game fast, it punishes you by not having any end game content, and if you play the game slow, it punishes you by having the difficulty go above what you‚Äôre capable of, making everything even slower. To get the most out of the game, you have to play as efficiently as possible while keeping a very specific speed as to not fall into the boredom that comes with moving too fast or slow, and that‚Äôs no fun.

The intro backstory is very VERY laggy. Like I couldn't really enjoy it and no matter how many times I close out the game and reopen it to see if it'll stop the lag, it doesn't. 

The second part is the game. The entire world is literally a black void, not even joking with you. There's nothing but black void. I was heavily confused and tried accessing the game controls and couldn't find them to see if it'll fix the black screen that I'm seeing. 

Last part is that Everytime the character steps in water, (can't see the water mainly because the entire world is a black void but know it's water because it keeps saying wet) it give this bright blob of light, not letting me see the character at all and it won't go away for like half a minute. 

These are the only problems I'm experiencing at the moment so I would really really REALLY be grateful if there was a way you guys could fix this because the game looks absolutely amazing from the ads. Since it's very much new to the public, I highly understand why this is happening. Which is why I'm still giving 4stars since this is very much excusable.

I've been playing this game for months now and its now my favorite app on the phone. I think the graphics are so detailed, and each character is made so finely and they each have their own special way. I love the voice-acting and the story line whenever you have a quest, and also that you ALWAYS have either a quest, or a commision, or some battling to do, so you're always active in the game. The only problem is, the game always keeps crashing, although it doesn't really affect the gameplay. Also, for some reason Mihoyo signed me out of the game, and when I tried to log back in it kept on saying that the password/username were incorrect, so I had to lose all of my progress and make a new accountDX But otherwise, this game is literally the best game!!!",5,BEST GAME EVER,2020-11-30 13:33:32,False

128,Altariusproto,"Honestly, I had no idea what to expect going into this game, but I am very impressed with what you can do. It plays like Breath of the Wild, in terms of exploration and item creation, but it also throws in elemental effects and statuses. You acquire different characters through the story, each one with an assigned element and fighting style, and by switching your party members you can create various effects both in combat and on the environment. There‚Äôs a huge area to explore, even if you don‚Äôt work on story quests immediately. The only issue I‚Äôve encountered so far is that it does make my phone overheat if I play too long, and then the game crashes. But you can also play on other formats, so if your phone can‚Äôt hack it, switch to PC or console versions.

It‚Äôs so hard to get the character I want to play because of the rng. I‚Äôd rather it be a confirmed purchase. You could spend hundreds of dollars and still not get the character you want. To me, that‚Äôs insane. Please fix this because this is the one out of two things that‚Äôs tearing down the game so badly. The other problem is the gems. The gems drop often, but not often enough. It‚Äôs 160 a roll and 1200 for 10 rolls together. On average you get like 20 from a mini-quest. I think the quantities need to be changed. 

So if you‚Äôre reading this, I highly recommend getting this game. It‚Äôs f2p, but if you want a high ranked character, you‚Äôll have to pay some. The amount I don‚Äôt know but likely a lot.

-The monsters...Fighting monsters are entertaining but it gets annoying when the monster leaves you alone at random..then you try and fight it again and guess what? It‚Äôs entire hp is back up. This frustrated me during some quests with difficult bosses..

-The frame rate...Even with strong internet connection, it sometimes crashes due to the graphics.

-loading time for cutscenes, areas, etc. can be a bit buggy and force me to restart my game..this too is frustrating since it can reset quests and interactions of characters..And even erase progress I have gotten..also some things don‚Äôt load completely in, example..Investigating a barrel and something pops out but it doesn‚Äôt appear at or it appears later..or it crashes the game, and cause more problems in playing.

On mobile it‚Äôs a bit annoying to move around as the camera continuously zooms back in I do wish there was a way to lock the camera zoom to where you want it.

The attacking is actually one of the best I‚Äôve seen as far as mobiles go.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a heck of a lot easier on a console/pc.

183,Chemical Burrito,"I‚Äôm playing this game on an iPad Pro, and the game is in bad need of controller support.  As it is, the game is difficult to play simply because the on-screen controls are uncomfortable on a large screen.  For a game which involves platforming and aiming and which also has a PC port and a PS4 port, ignoring controller support is inexcusable.  Hopefully, this will be patched in soon -this would warrant a few more stars for this review.

The gacha system for obtaining new allies is brutal - some of the lowest rates you‚Äôll find (0.6% for a 5*).  They don‚Äôt seem to be super generous with currency at the moment, so you should go into the game expecting to be playing with the story-provided characters and one or two other 4* characters unless you commit to whaling.

The game occasionally decides it wants to take several minutes to load (on a white screen), so if that happens to you, you probably just need to wait a few more minutes before trying to restart the game.  It doesn‚Äôt happen EVERY time you load the game, but I‚Äôve encountered this several times so far.  Bug?

Frustrating controls and brutal gacha aside, the game looks very good for a gacha game and is actually fun when you‚Äôre not wrestling with the clunky controls.  To me, the game feels more like Sword Art Online: Lost Song for the PlayStation Vita than anything else - right down to the flying in Lost Song and ‚Äúsingle player MMO-like‚Äù feel that all the Vita SAO games had.",2,Needs controller support and some optimization,2020-10-28 04:23:26,False

Hell, even for a console or PC game, the open world experience is very immersive and captivating.

A lot of the fun for me is in the story and the gameplay. It‚Äôs surprisingly good story and character voice-overs will keep you entertained, as an RPG should.

My biggest complaint is probably that is just a bit too open world, and there aren‚Äôt too many activities to keep your interest for more than an hour or two at a time. This is a fine game to help you relax, but as a grind, it can be kind of boring. 

There is a lot of ambition to this game, and I can‚Äôt wait to see just what they plan to release in the upcoming months, especially in terms of multiplayer. For what it‚Äôs worth, there is a lot to do right now, and I recommend diving in now while it is so popular. 

To summarize, it‚Äôs among the top 5 most gorgeous mobile games you can play. Cross-platform, and very little bugs and gameplay issues, but you will spend a lot of time exploring and wandering the big open-world, so be prepared for a lot of silence and atmosphere.",5,Absolutely amazing!,2020-10-10 19:46:02,False

The drop rate on the characters you want are lower than any other gacha game I have played and funny enough the pity system only kicks in after 90pulls which is about $200 and you don‚Äôt even obtain your 5-star character you want but a 5-star Weapon instead. They aren‚Äôt even going to do anything till people have complained enough about their bad practices, even the Chinese community have rated this game a 4.7/10, so that should tell you something since the game is created by a Chinese Company. Either way, they aren‚Äôt going to release any updates till Nov 11, so a month of being in a pathetic state till they maybe fix the game.

I think the strength of some monsters makes it more enjoyable.

Anyways, my point is I am in love with the game, story and dialogue is good so far, acting is interesting, and as an artist that draws, and paints traditionally, and digitally. I am impressed with graphics, animation, and art style of the characters. Paimon is so cute and the other characters. 

What could use some improvement is that I‚Äôve been experiencing some lag. While playing which is interrupting my game experience, and also the app crashing is another problem which I gave this game 4/5 stars. 

Also this is not feedback, but it would be lovely if you make this game available on MacOS and PC which would be amazing. Because I‚Äôm worried about using up a lot of storage on my iPhone 8 with 64 GB. So it would be a good idea if someday if you developers make MacOS and PC version of Genshin Impact.

It reminds me of several games, including breath of the wild, but it also has its own unique vibe that is pretty fun. Paimon can be annoying at times, mainly for the constant reference to herself in the third person. Again though this game has pulled me away from some big triple a titles, as well as others like warframe. My only fear is that it may get a bit repetitive, like warframe did.

However, a normal part of playing an RPG is progression- you become stronger and are able to face stronger enemies. But because of the gacha mechanics, that‚Äôs just not there. I can be 10 or so levels higher than the enemies that I‚Äôm fighting but because I haven‚Äôt gotten a 5 star character with a 5 star weapon, combat takes an inordinately long time. You‚Äôll find yourself needing to use 2 or more full weapon combos on low level trash enemies. Never mind the 10 minute fights for larger enemies well below my level. You have enough HP to survive their attacks, so it's not challenging, its just tedious.

It just becomes 10 min of dailies and log off. Co op is incredibly buggy and has little value still. The storyline ends at AR29 and you will be almost done with all content by there. The next update is in 5 weeks(verified by mihoyo), but it isn‚Äôt even a big content patch. The first big one is scheduled for 12/23, so be prepared for very little things to do compared to your first week. Lastly, the gacha rate is 0.6% for a 5 star, the lowest rate of any big gacha out there. They also stop giving you free rolls pretty soon so it‚Äôs not f2p friendly at all. 
Unless Mihoyo makes some big changes in the coming updates or adds in some small frequent patches, there is very little content later on and not much to do.",1,Smooth sailing in the beginning then wait 10 weeks for content,2020-10-09 17:30:40,False
215,PieDragon,"This is a very well thought out and well made game. A lot of love went into every nook and cranny of its gameplay and world. Unfortunately... it‚Äôs a gacha, and not exactly a generous one at that. The early summon gift is kind but a bit frustrating to be rolling weapons that feel more like gear level fodder than meaningful results. I‚Äôm glad to support a game that has more direct ways of doing so- whether that be cosmetic purchases or an outright cost to play- but it feels frustrating knowing that others have very different and possibly better gameplay experiences not based on meaningful RPG choice but because they paid and rolled better.

As a game, it‚Äôs competent and gorgeous to look at. I never thought Breath of the Wild mixed with a more traditional RPG would work, but this is clear proof that it does. If you can look past the gacha elements- then give this game a try.",4,"Impressed, but also annoyed",2020-09-30 04:12:00,False

This game truly makes Nintendo look stupid. With the power of this iPad 60fps RPG type games are a must and this is one of the best ones i have ever played. I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone of all ages especially adults. Thank you for making this well designed game, I hope other companies see how amazing this game is and they try to make an even better one.

217,nannerbdale,"I rarely leave reviews on apps, and never play mobile games, they‚Äôre just not my thing. I started playing Genshin Impact reluctantly on PC as I‚Äôm apt to spend lots of money on these types of games (gacha). 

I can gladly say that the mobile version of the game is very easy to use and almost as good as the PC version! This is the only game I enjoy on mobile, and I love that I can pick up where I left off on PC and vice versa.

The games soundtrack, world, and art style are all very well done. It drags you into the world and it feels fresh. Although the developers say that Breath of the Wild wasn‚Äôt an influence in its creation (probably to avoid lawsuit), one can easily see it at play here. And let me just say, that‚Äôs not a bad thing.

As far as micro transactions go, most people say you can get through the whole game without paying a penny. Those that want all 5* characters and weapons will of course spend, but it‚Äôs not necessary by any means. I willfully spent $30 my first day, and got 3 characters I‚Äôm happy with, but by no means was I forced to or needed to do progress. The only complaint I see around is the resin system, which was put in play to keep addiction in Chinese culture down.

Ofc there‚Äôs some loading issues, and occasional lag spikes, but if you get past that, it‚Äôs wonderful. However, I hear it is out on console, so I tried to use my controller to play it (I use an Xbox controller so maybe that was the issue) but was a little disappointed to find it didn‚Äôt work on mobile. Ever since controllers were able to be used on IOS games, I‚Äôve preferred to use it instead of touch. It‚Äôs a bit more responsive and easy to handle.

219,Anthony_RC,"I love the art and music. When I first played it, I was supposed to talk to this fairy thing. But I didn't see it around, so I just picked an interesting direction and walked. I saw a city of windmills in the distance so I decided to go check it out. I explored it, battled some monsters, gathered herbs, killed harmful wild boars and used their meat, learned how to cook(!) and learned to glide from high places to lower ones, gained some levels and eventually got a little bored.

Then I remembered the fairy, so I teleported back to where I started and found her. She then proceeded to teach me how to play the game. Except I'd already learned what she was saying. In fact she told me to kill some monsters and open their treasure chest... and I already had. They weren't there before and the chest lay empty. I chuckled at that.

After that, I played the game as designed, and the quests are fun and beautiful. Except I was a much higher level due to my exploring so the quests were easier than they should be.

The combat takes actual thought. I've defeated foes way too difficult for me by tricking them and using my characters in just the right way. Unlike other iPhone games where you can just turn on auto-combat and your strategy is uneeded.",5,"Thoughtful, beautiful and fun!",2020-10-30 23:24:55,False
220,Lucikrux,"This is a free open world RPG better in some ways than Breath of the Wild, though worse in others of course due to mobile restrictions, and it‚Äôs free.

Free. Like, really. What? I spent some money in the gacha because of retail therapy(help me) but honestly you don‚Äôt need to spend any money to get all of the characters. It‚Äôs just pay to progress faster, you can progress just fine though through normal gameplay.

Story is decent, better than a lot of mobile games. Paiman is annoying as heck but you get used to her eventually... think of how annoying Navi is in the original OOT. It‚Äôs like that but worse. The English dub is mediocre but like... you can switch from it to Japanese, Chinese, Korean... the only downside, you miss out on some additional lines that aren‚Äôt subbed so... try to deal with English if you can? If not, it‚Äôs not a huge deal.

Combat is pretty tight, but it can be pretty boring on some characters/elements. However, luckily you get to unlock more skills later, so it‚Äôs probably far more interesting later down the line. Some enemies are very difficult, and you should hold off before fighting them, while others are cake.

Overall I‚Äôd give the game a 7/10 if it were a console game... but this? This is a mobile game. 10/10",5,Giiiirl,2020-10-03 02:35:32,False

The one thing that sets thsi game apart from other games is that it is free to play completely. Leveling up and getting far in the game is all up to how much time you put to the game.

This is because of Zhongli. Zhongli was a very hyped up character, not to mention he is an important character (as important as Venti, to not spoil anything). Yet this poor guy hits like a wet noodle. A FIVE STAR CHARACTER IS WEAKER THAN XIANGLING WHO IS FREE AND IS A RANDOM TEENAGE COOK!!
Why, might you ask? Well MiHoYo probably saw how well Childe sold and how much they got people to whale for not only the character but his constellations. I feel like Zhongli is even worse with this. Half his kit is locked behind a paywall, and remember, as a gacha game, this is not even guarantee to get all his constellations (unless you‚Äôre crazy enough to hit pity again and again).

227,FanGamer21,"Alright, so I pre-ordered this game a few months back, and now that I‚Äôm playing it, I‚Äôve noticed a few things. It feels, and plays, like a retextured version, of Zelda Breath Of The Wild! I‚Äôll list a couple of things I noticed...

1. The stamina bar, works exactly like the Zelda games‚Äô stamina bar, and when you climb something, it‚Äôs undoubtedly similar.

2. The storyline is even similar, a person who is close to the protagonist, gets captured by this godlike being, and it‚Äôs your job to rescue that person.

3. The game has gliders, literally gliders, they function the exact way the gliders in Zelda do.

4. When you switch over to a different character, such as someone with a bow, it works the same way as in Zelda, and with a tank class, if you hold down the attack button, it will send you spinning as a special attack, and eats up your stamina, oh, and guess what? It works the same way as Zelda.

5. The enemies? They almost aren‚Äôt even retextured, they just all look the same as the enemies from Zelda.

6. The game, is fun, and has an engaging storyline nevertheless, but it only has so little unique features to not get a lawsuit from Nintendo. Overall, fun game, but a little sus on the original side.

245,jars&mass,"I downloaded the game today and have been playing ALL DAY LONG. I honestly love these types of games and can never get enough. When they said open world, they really meant it. I spent hours simply just exploring and grinding. I usually hate to grind but this game changes each monster battle every time. I love the flying aspect of the game as well. 
Some issues I noticed: sometimes the character's feet will glitch through the ground, also the voiceover sometimes does not match what it says in the text. 
They're not huge issues but can take someone out of the fantasy of the game.
Also got some cool loot early on thanks to the developers and their freebies. sadly, i am still a student so i have other responsibilities to attend to, but I can't wait to keep playing again tomorrow",5,Addicting AF,2020-09-30 09:48:07,False

247,meepsthememer,I love love this game it‚Äôs so fun and interesting and definitely addicting. When I was on a quest ( and this treasure goes to )  and I went to the tree in  lingju pass. And as I was fighting the characters sometimes they would teleport in middle of the battle to where they spawned and would regain all their health. I after an hour of trying to kill the bad guys managed to get 2 of them. But the last one the purple one no matter how many times I hit him he gets a little bit low in health then teleports back and regains all his health again.

There‚Äôs a lot of lore too if you‚Äôre into that sorta thing xD. 

A few complaints...some sort of healer in town would be nice. Getting food to heal is a chore, on top of the ‚Äúbeing full‚Äù mechanic, which is a pain if you‚Äôre trying to take down a boss.

Despite the backlash of it being a ‚ÄúBOTW‚Äù ripoff it really isn‚Äôt. There are aspects of BOTW in the game like climbing, gliding, graphics, etc. However the story and gameplay is different. So to the people who dislike it for being a clone, play first.

Overall I am very happy about this game. The need to use money is optional and the game gives you a decent lineup of characters at the start to handle every encounter. My only hope for the gacha system is the occasional gift or event for players to use it from time to time.

I would highly recommend this game to my friends and I can‚Äôt wait to play more.

Current minor bug that‚Äôs bothering me comes from the voice dialogue. 
Is it just me or does the game start treating you like the twin brother?

This game can keep you busy for hours on end with a thrilling story, fun quests, puzzles and hard fights. My only problem so far has been with the gacha system and leveling system. So far the gacha system has been extremely disappointing with terrible rates for characters. For example I spent $40 and got duplicates characters, nothing new. The leveling system has also been a pain with it being too hard to get Adventurer XP and Character XP being too low on the World Bosses. Final thing to note, Primogems are way too hard to get. If you want to get a new character like Venti you‚Äôd have to get 1600 Primogems just to have a good chance.",4,Great but has some Faults,2020-10-21 02:46:24,False

The biggest issue is that the game is a gacha game, which wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if it was fair but the pull rate for a 5* is 1 per 90 or 0.6% whichever comes first, Which more often than not you will hit the 90 first. Other games in this same category have a 7.0% pull rate. Meaning you are more than 10 times more likely with this games competitors. 

There is no free daily summons, no daily log in rewards, no rewards monthly calendar, and the rewards run dry after the first few hours of leveling. The game makes you trial hero‚Äôs so you will see how much better than yours they are. 

If you do all the content to level 25 in less than a month there is no more game left. You become a trash collector trying to find all the trash chests in the world for just a little bit more exp / money / artifacts / weapons / books so you can progress. But that runs dry around level 30. 
There is nothing to do after the main story quests. And the things that are available are tied to a ticket system called resin which holds you back even more because of the random low drop rate and random rolls on gear. 

The resin system allows you to do 2-6 ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù daily depending on which you do. These have low drop rate on resources or items of a useable tier. So progression is locked behind months to years of daily play.",1,0.6% gacha rate,2020-10-08 15:53:53,False

1. why is gaining pirogems so hard?? i get that the pirogem currency isnt supposed to be easily obtained to make people spend money but does it have to be this hard? after a point your only source of pgems (that matters) becomes the infrequent gifts they send pls make it at least a little easier
2. why is it that u can only play with people in your area.. idk much about this stuff but im p sure there are ways to allow people from different parts of the world to play together. i have american and european friends and we cant play together! playing together was the main reason why we downloaded the game so its somewhat disappointing

I even so far don‚Äôt mind how much of a grind leveling is because it‚Äôs sort of fun, but I think like other reviews the pay to win aspect will come out the longer it‚Äôs played. I also would rather monetization focus on customizing, skins, clothes, avatar hair options and how you look, and open up a little more of the nice weapons and characters drops from wishing. 

My largest issue isn‚Äôt one everyone would share, and I think I might even get made fun of for how I feel about it, but I wish in the story I wouldn‚Äôt be forced to ‚Äúworship‚Äù the statues in order to progress. Maybe it‚Äôs just the wording. I don‚Äôt mind leaving orbs but I don‚Äôt like being forced to participate in a game religion even if the game is focused on it. I didn‚Äôt have an issue with the story at all until I realized leveling the statues requires ‚Äúworshipping‚Äù them and that‚Äôs not ok with me. 

I might stop playing entirely because of that but will see if I can still progress if I choose not to do that part. 

Suggestion: change the words from ‚Äúworship‚Äù to ‚Äúleave an offering‚Äù

I know that it is not real and I am not really worshiping a statue.

They could use terms like ‚Äúclean statue‚Äù or ‚Äúupgrade rock‚Äù in order to allow others to play the game so not to offend possible players.

At first this game is enjoyable but once you get to Adventure Rank 40+ and done everything it is all about maxing out and grinding till you drop game.

End game materials will take you YEARS to complete because 1 character might take 6months to max out even if you‚Äôre the luckiest gamer in RnG history (materials are so rare and RnG + can only be farmed once a WEEK).

Gacha rates are sooo LOW that the developers refused to show the drop rate and made it to 50pulls guarantee which sounds good to many but really it‚Äôs just saying that mandatory 50pulls for your S hero so whale if you want 7 of them to max out or to even be viable to end game bosses.

Also you need many good different heroes to play because of elemental properties for different enemies. The free heroes are trash and boring.

Hero progression is one thing to worry about but wait there‚Äôs more!! you got artifacts with RnG base stats, what about weapons? well Yeah! you need good weapons too!.  So grind till you‚Äôre wallet is empty or grind till you say it quits.

This game is soo grindy with little rewards, it will stress you more than relax you. RnG is the worse and very P2W/Whale focus game.

This game is full with potential to come by how it already looks there is no doubt this game is a successor, really gives of a different vibe and controls to the game, finding stuff , actually having to read what the NPC say, to get to point A and point B.

Pets would honestly be nice in the game and having to feed them when they attack the monsters for u and there health goes down.

Edit: Now level 50 across all my characters, still very fun and addicting!

Edit 2: Now level 60-70. I‚Äôve lowered my rating by two stars because I‚Äôve now had the game crash three times on me during very important fights in the Spiral Abyss. Very annoying. I have over 50% free space on my iPhone 11 and have tried uninstalling/reinstalling and restarting but it‚Äôs still crashing even with lowered visual settings.

These are the worst rates I‚Äôve ever seen on any gacha. And the fact that you can get weapons on the same limited banner as characters just makes it worse. The only saving grace is that pity carries over . Next up is Resin. There is just not enough to actually farm things. The model is just predatory, and it is basically the only thing you can do after you reach AR 29 which you reach within a week or 2 of playing since the story is not yet finished. There is just not enough to farm mats and artifacts in domains, do the weekly bosses, do the elite bosses, and do the ley line challenges. You cannot reach the BP goals without using primogems to replenish Resin. Kind of cringe dude. No wonder this game is getting review bombed in CN.

315,hiko27,"Gave a 1 star review because mainly of account security issues. The company has had two security vulnerabilities exposed in the past few months already (mind you, this is a company founded in 2012 and has had lots of experience in these types of games). First one was how easily hackers could grab your phone number if you linked it, and the second was your email. And now, apparently, there‚Äôs a way for hackers to get your name from your linked social media accounts (especially Facebook) very easily as long as they know your password.

The community‚Äôs been trying to push for 2FA because security is important. Imagine spending a hundred or so on an account and that it can easily be hacked through brute force. They don‚Äôt notify you if your email/phone number gets unlinked either. And what‚Äôs more, they‚Äôre most likely aware of these, but haven‚Äôt fixed them. And they haven‚Äôt made an announcement addressing these issues.

At this point, making an account is all at-your-own-risk. Until they fix the vulnerabilities and start listening to the players more often, only then will I change this review.

Yes, it‚Äôs a great game with great characters, amazing design, wonderful music and a fun rpg element to it. But that all comes at a cost that your account can be taken out of nowhere.",1,"Security issues mainly, and not willing to listen to major feedback",2020-12-10 07:27:56,False

Whether it‚Äôs the beautiful graphics of the open world, the fluid-like gameplay similar to BotW, or the Gacha system, it has been a pretty awesome experience! People complain about the probability rates of the Gacha system but that‚Äôs how RnG works. 

Now to the part I wanted to complain about, Co-op mode. The main reason I wanted to play this game was to enjoy it with my friends as we progress through the story, however that was all put to a stop once we got to rank 16 (the rank requirement to start co-op). The options were so limited for my friends that I thought they should‚Äôve just left this as a single player game. The only thing they can do is participate in my dungeons, loot materials such as iron chunks, and explore the world with their story progression being halted. I was hoping we would be able to progress through the game together, but that hope sure did get squashed. In the future, I am anticipating some major improvements to the co-op feature to make this game more enjoyable for the player and their friends.

Other than that this game has been a delightful experience

I'm not joking when I say the only significant portion of progression you gain from playing each day is at the first 10-20 minutes of gameplay when you do your daily commissions and spend your Resin, and after that you get hardly anything worthwhile. Making all of the chests respawn each week would also help with this, as the open world feels completely empty after you've gone through each area once or twice, and it doesn't require any Resin. This game has a ton of potential but if MiHoYo doesn't bring change to things like Resin soon then they're going to lose their playerbase fast.",1,Resin System Needs Changes,2020-10-23 05:05:24,False

You can‚Äôt even do quests with other people nor can you open the chests. Even if the person who works you joined open a chest, you don‚Äôt get any loot.

 Also, there should be something like a gifting system or perhaps a trading system. For example, when you have too much of an item and have no need for it, you can always trade it with someone for something you actually need. 

However, the graphics of the game is on point! It‚Äôs so breathtaking, like the graphics and gameplay are so well put together!! The characters are nice as well and I really love the game. 

The anime aesthetic plus the open world adventure is so also well designed. Another feature that I (and probably many other players as well) like is the fact that you can mark places.

I feel kind of sad for those who have not experienced breath of the wild first, which, is a beautiful game by the way.

Of course it‚Äôll be laggy, because the main botw map was intended for the nintendo switch rather, and not a mobile game. It‚Äôs a bit upsetting knowing the game style; map and such as was copied and yet sits here free to use even; despite the rest of the game being original, breath of the wild definitely deserves credit.

Other than that the game is cool and I like the concept, props to the makers but I hope this game doesn‚Äôt overshadow the creativity and beauty of breath of the wild, and I hope it is known.",4,I can‚Äôt love it.,2020-10-20 00:09:47,False

However, once you get through the honeymoon phase and get to a certain Adventure rank, you hit a wall that is mainly caused by the resin system. This severely limits your progress in the later parts of the game. I know this is a gatcha game, so that includes some energy system. However, the game does not give much options to recharge your resin besides having you spend money. I would be happier if they added other ways to recharge resin. Such as when you rank up your Adventure Rank, complete all your daily commissions, and allow us to go over the cap. Also the 5 star rates are waaay to low. if they added ways for f2p players to obtain 4 and 5 star characters easier, it would be amazing.",3,Great game but has problems.,2020-10-14 18:33:43,False

That being said, I love the exploration aspect of the game, and the combat is fun and interesting. The character progression could use some work, and the story could use better writers. But the voice acting (where present) is really good.

My final verdict is don‚Äôt play it here on your mobile device. Get it on a platform they care about, like PC or Xbox or (when they release it) on Switch. The crashes here are nearly unbearable, and it very much ruins the experience.",2,"Great game, bad crashes",2020-10-18 19:15:49,False

Disappointing considering all the feedback they received during closed beta and the more fair & sustainable system in their previous game Honkai Impact 3rd. Baffling considering they reduced the amount of currency you can earn in Abyss from the beta considering the atrocious rates. Well below industry standards. Sad to see that they pushed monetization to the limit for launch, damaging dedicated long term investment in the process. Story is also unimportant with unskippable cutscenes.

383,gachagren,"As a person who is not new to GACHA games, the resin (aka energy) system in this game is horrible. This game wants to be an open world MMO, and for the first 20 ranks feels exactly like it. Once you finish the story content though get ready for a serious drop in things to complete thanks to the lack of content and resin system. End game type items are dropped by bosses and domains but the only way to actually get the drops is to have enough resin to ‚Äúreceive drops‚Äù, if you don‚Äôt- you can waste time fighting them and will receive nothing as a result.

Not only that but unlike other GACHA games, your resin doesn‚Äôt increase with rank ups, so you‚Äôre severely limited to how many battles you can actually do. The only 2 ways to replenish this are with items that are sparsely given out (which don‚Äôt even fully replenish resin) or canibalize primo gems (used for summons for characters) which means you can‚Äôt summon as many times to try and get hero‚Äôs you want. Another thing tied to the resin system: experience books to level up your heroes. What does that mean? 

You either have to spend money to play the game, or sit by idle and spend 20 minutes a day on the game and then log off while you wait for resin to replenish.

Collecting characters is pretty good, its a little hard to collect Primogems, I‚Äôd recommend adding in more side quests.

There are only a couple issues.

#1) not enough content, it‚Äôs been only 5 days since release and I have already finished almost everything. I am Adventure rank 33 and now all there is to do is search for chests, I have literally finished everything else. 

#2) the co-op leaves much to be desired. No real incentive to do co-op. Want to see more multiplayer options & benefits. Things you can only achieve by co-op (for example really hard large raids or bosses)

#3) there should be a way to extract materials. There is a set amount of materials in the game (mostly through chests & quests). Once those are completed, it‚Äôs extremely hard to find weapons or accessories. You then upgrade your current gear, to find better gear later.... but you have already spent most of your resources on those precious weapons. Need to have a resource extraction system.

Now, let me be clear. I love, love, love the set up of this game and I‚Äôm having a blast with the open world play. It‚Äôs not overly complex and I like the random side quests that pop up. The cooking feature is  fun too.

I can navigate about 1/2 the map with a spotlight surrounding the character, which works fine most of the time. And even when the screen goes completely black (aside from the controls) it isn‚Äôt impossible to move around provided you‚Äôve unlocked the map for that area. Which is ALSO possible to do with a black screen lol. The rain seems to trigger it in Liyue and surrounding areas.

However completing certain quests are nigh impossible. The Gliding Test and Stormterrors Lair: Empty Abode have ground my gameplay to a near stop. Since I can‚Äôt make any leeway on those I‚Äôve just been focusing on level grinding, which isn‚Äôt nearly as satisfying.

So far from what I‚Äôve experienced it‚Äôs been a lot of fun and I‚Äôm looking forward to see what else the game has in store. There are a few things that could be improved, however:

1. I don‚Äôt know what it is but the camera on mobile is really weird. It would be great if the camera was sort of soft-locked to a perspective that followed the character‚Äôs movements a bit more because sometimes you‚Äôll get swarmed by enemies but the camera is locked to an awkward position making it hard to see. No doubt camera controls work better on PC or console but it‚Äôs definitely troublesome on mobile.

2. Obstacles remain opaque when they block the camera‚Äôs view. I‚Äôll be in the middle of fighting a boss creature and accidentally run under a tree and now I can‚Äôt see anything but the top of the tree.

The graphics are one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in any game I‚Äôve ever downloaded or looked at. They‚Äôre so beautiful- download and see for yourself.
The story is very intriguing and interesting. And Paimon is just such a cutie!
I do really like the wish system (very very similar to the supply drops in Honkai Impact 3rd) however I‚Äôve been buying and buying but no such luck of me getting Klee (then again I‚Äôm very obsessed about getting Klee because she‚Äôs just soooo adorable and definitely my favorite playable character!).
So, overall, this game is very worth the download as it is simply stunning and one of the greatest games on the App Store.

465,Manga--X,"Genshin Impact completely raises the bar when it comes to mobile games.  While also launching on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Windows, the mobile release provides the same, full experience.

The lovingly detailed graphics can be cranked to max on an iPhone 10 (other experiences may be different), and the music is extremely well done throughout.  Surprisingly enough, the English voiceovers are also quite competent (something that‚Äôs almost unheard of when it comes to anime style games).

Impressively, progression is stored in real-time.  Regardless of when the game is closed (aside from cutscenes), it will always resume at that exact location (along with every carried item) the next time it‚Äôs launched.

The vast, magical world features a massive amount of content already.  Exploring it is a joy, and I genuinely look forward to how it will continue to grow from here.

I am playing this on an iPhone 11 Pro Max currently.

-Graphics are really great! Colors are vibrant and details are well thought out.

-The option of 60 FPS is awesome! Hopefully even higher FPS in the next updates!

-Seems to be many character choices with various specialties. Such as Pyro type hero using spell book or a Pyro hero using a physical weapon.

-Open world seems to be decently vast, and your character can scale many different objects. 

I have played/play other games where you have a team of characters and a fairly open world realm. But this one tops those so far in many ways.

This game isn‚Äôt cluttered with an infinite stream of random chats popping up. It also doesn‚Äôt have a ton of ads for in shop items available to purchase all over the screen.

1) I can only see about 10 feet around my character and then it‚Äôs pitch black. Makes it so I have to explore almost blind and combat with ranged enemies is a pain.

2) any body of water is pitch black as well and whenever I touch water my character becomes a shining ball of light until a few seconds after I leave the water.

3) kind of a common one for new games, but the app crashes quite a bit and at random it seems.

4) cutscenes are extremely laggy and cut in and out until it runs through the scene.

I have tried all the common fixes to these kind of issues but none have worked. I deleted and downloaded, adjusted both my iPad and game settings, and restarted my iPad each multiple times with no luck. I am really excited for this game and hope they can fix these issues as it is unplayable at this point for me.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong this game is extremely addicting once you get into it as most games should, but the fact that it‚Äôs a pc game that turned into a mobile app was a really big issue for me.

Now I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs there‚Äôs anything wrong with it, its just the fact that not everyone can enjoy an open world RPG as an app. So my suggestions are that if you‚Äôre planning on creating an app based on an Open World RPG platform which keep in mind, ‚Äúwas made on PC‚Äù.

489,Jay malvin,I love the game. But... I hate how it boils down to luck and gambling. So of course it's a gacha game and you have to put money to get characters. Other games allow you to get 5star characters with enough work. This doesn't. The drop rate on the 5star char is like 0.01. I wish they'd change it to cumulative chance. Other games do this where the more you spend the higher the chance of getting the character you want. Soon reaching a point where it's a guaranteed drop. I just feel left behind by 1) guys who are super lucky 2) guys with a ton of money. I really wish they'd fix this. If they do I see myself staying for longer and spending more cash on this nice game.,4,It's a gambling game,2020-10-19 02:08:34,False

I think Im AR38 and Im happy to say I hardly know or care whats going on story wise, but the gameplay is fun and addicting.

1. Bosses will sometimes disappear. You can‚Äôt see them and you can‚Äôt do damage to them until they glitch back in. When they do glitch back in, it is sometimes with a refilled health bar. 
2. The story is incomplete, so in order to make it seem like it is enough content, progressing through is painfully slow and barred by your ‚Äúadventure rank‚Äù stat that you can only upgrade quickly through hours and hours of gameplay or money. 
3. Free to play is heavily punished. I understand they need to make a profit, but if that‚Äôs true then put some cost up front. Don‚Äôt ever count on getting a five star character. 
4. Aiming arrow shots is broken, completely useless. Don‚Äôt aim yourself, rely on the auto-aim.

Most games this style, raja or gacha games there doing stuff all time to the point that it‚Äôs hard to stay on track and then the tasks become boring lists. However, this game rewards down time by giving tons of hidden things.

526,Volthrax,"Masterful combination of rpg elements, gacha, exploration and combat akin to Zelda breath of the wild, skyrim and assassins creed. Only a few things holding this back from a 5/5 for me. the lack of primagems in the end game. As well as the usual complaint of resin. Would be nice to have other instances or raids to complete with other people for regular rewards (outside of using resin for mundane daily activities.)

The rates are fine as is, with a guaranteed 5 star every 90 rolls, but being able to do a 10 roll once every week and a half is slightly infuriating, especially when it turns out to be a favonius weapon dupe.

Events are definitely a work in progress but only add to the fun factor. (Again, co op events and the like should be separated from the resin system, literally was able to play for like an hour with friends before we were done, all the built up excitement for nothing.)

There is in app purchases but they aren't necessary as they give you some for free and have multiple ways of paying with items earned in-game.

562,Gadius X,I gave this game a 1 star without even playing it myself. But after playing for about 30 hours on PC  I decided to give 5 stars. This game is amazing. For those wondering about the gacha system. It‚Äôs really not that bad unless you are a collector. I just did 1 beginner summon and have been using the characters I got from it for 30 hours. If you can master your characters you obtained from the beginner pulls you can easily beat content. The only way I would do more summons is if I get bored of using the same characters (which I‚Äôm not). Can‚Äôt wait to see the other worlds. Beidou #1 btw ü•∞,5,Wow,2020-10-05 03:48:18,False

572,Itian_n,"i loooove the story of Genshin Impact. It feels like a complete anime story. I like the assortment of characters, and they way the story makes you feel fall in love with them. 

that said, i haaaate the fighting control. the control limits my view on where i am going, and if the battle is happening near trees, it obscures the view. i guess that‚Äôs why they made healing really easy by letting the player pause and get food.

another thing that i hate is the archers controls. i try to aim, but then when i adjust the aim, i accidentally press the aim button so i lose the aim mode. this has gotten me into trouble several times especially in boss fights.

but the story is soooo good, and the graphics even at low setting is fantastic. i also love the glide mode and some small puzzles where you try to figure out what should be done in one situation, then later you find put that you did this before, ie time warp.

The lore and character interactions are abundant and meaningful. The gacha system in Genshin Impact is an afterthought. What makes the game more unique than other gachas is the pity currency and how its dupe system improves characters and weapons significantly - not their stats, but their passive abilities, making them much more effective in a combat system that relies on environmental mechanics more than numbers.
One major weakness is the game's lack of free currency, or rather, the amount of Primogems being limited to the world.

2. You can only find junks in the chest around the map. Because all good weapons and characters are in the pool.
3. Stupid pooling chance. Characters and weapons are in the same pool. 0.6% chance for 5 star characters and 5 star weapon. 1.6% chance for 4 star characters and 4 star weapon. 
4. Expensive in game purchase. It took you approximately 20 dollars for 10 draws. 4 star is Guaranteed every 10 draws. It can be characters and weapon. 5 star is guaranteed every 90 draws. But with my experience, the chance you spend 100 dollars on the pool, there will be 99% of chance of drawing a weapon.
5. Hollow world. Once you reached adventure level 29, there is no more main story. All left in the game is grinding for gears.
6. You can only farm 6 dungeons per day if you do not use your dollar. Running 6 dungeons will take you about 8 mins. And you have 4 daily quest per day taking you 10 mins. And that‚Äôs all. Nothing else for you to play. All you can do is go offline and enjoy your normal life.

The gacha system is already bad so I won‚Äôt talk about that, but the stamina system is so bad it makes the game just miserable. You are gated hard by the amount you can play because of the stamina system. It makes too hard to raise new characters. So optimally you invest in 1, but even doing that, there‚Äôs not enough stamina to get enough materials/money to even afford 1 character. At that point why roll for new characters when you won‚Äôt be able to even use them?

Not only that but the content is just not there. Once you have explored the world, done the story, and opened all of the chests, your content is now running around opening common chests that have respawned and drop virtually nothing.

644,Neph XO,"This game is great, but let‚Äôs be honest, its nearly unplayable on mobile because it lacks controller support. It was developed alongside two other versions that support controller and mouse and keyboard, but this one doesn‚Äôt even support controller. 

For one, it‚Äôs a pain to just pick up items. constantly moving the position of my hand to mash away on items, or even to simply talk to someone is extremely annoying. 

Combat isn‚Äôt undoable, but it‚Äôs clunky compared to mouse and keyboard and controller. Archery is a pain unless you‚Äôve been playing a lot of shooters on touch controls, and tbf, I‚Äôve played mobile shooters and it just seems sloppy on here in comparison to say COD or PUBG. 

It‚Äôs a small feature to add, to simply map the same controls you mapped for the other two versions, and I‚Äôm certain many of us will appreciate that.

Battery drains significantly on my end.

Mats are grind-y and takes a while to gather for both weapons and chars leveling.

Resin locked loot is a bit of a hassle but deters from people playing ALL day to get a certain loot...unless they are a whale who‚Äôll throw down for resins.

Primogems for random weapons and charas you probably do(n‚Äôt) want. Can be used for reset/gain max resin.

Enemies become tougher when world level increase. Watch you adventure rank (AR) and lvl up wisely.

Bounties and the other newly added quest seems forceful to complete imo.

No controller support for iphone.

Everything else is fantastic.

 iphone 8 force close and overheats still.

The issues I do have are as follows:

1. Lack of meaningful co-op quests, adventures and gameplay. The one event that just came out, the Elemental Crucible, was buggy and laggy most of the time. I guess this could be due to the server overload. It gets lonely and boring running stuff by yourself all the time. 

2. Lack of Resin - The resin gets spent so fast that you find yourself running around in other people‚Äôs world stealing their materials just to spend quality time together.

3. Clunky artifact equipment 
system - no mechanism to lock the artifacts that you want to keep. When combining weapons or artifacts, no info interface to tell you what you‚Äôre combining. And I don‚Äôt know..just feels clunky.

803,Ace0fClubs0001,"The Good:
Firstly, this game is a must try. Solely for the combat, game world, and beautiful art style. The open world exploration and story is enough to give you 20+ hours of gameplay. 

The Bad: 
What‚Äôs disappointing about this game is that a lot of content is gated by a ridiculously low stamina system with a ridiculously long refresh timer. All of the activities meant to give your characters exp and weapon progression is tied to this stamina system. Not my first Gacha but compared to ones I‚Äôve played, this system is by far horrendous. This is a Gacha game so I understand but they need to give a daily stamina refresh just for logging in. 

The Ugly:
Gacha rates are ridiculously low at 0.6% drop rate for a 5 Star with a 90 Roll pity timer.. which equals about $200 bucks for one 5 Star for character banners. Which the game does not have 3 Star characters so you would think it would even out but they dilute pulls by including weapons in character banner pulls.

804,RageComic9001,"First 30-40 hours of gameplay are great. Full open world and things to do.

Then endgame hits and you cant do anything

Once story ends very abruptly and you lose all easy ways to get adventure exp, you are stuck doing dailies and burning resin for everything.

Especially burning resin for EVERYTHING

Progression is directly tied to resin since you need resin for any meaningful accumulation for everything.

Leylines for Mora and Character exp? 20 Resin
Artifacts? 20 Resin
Weapon Ascension Mats? 20 Resin
Talent Mats? 20 Resin
Character Ascension Mats? 40 Resin
Weekly bosses that can only be done 1/week? 60 Resin

This would be better if they had a short resin regen and high cap right? 

Regen is 1/8 minutes and the cap is 120

Doing weeklies will take up half of your saved resin, and why bother doing anything else that day? 

This is not including the 6-7 layers of gear RNG tied to each artifact. 

Its a fun one-off at the beginning 30-40 hours of play, but once you hit endgame you should just delete and find something else.

Pros;
The game is fun.
Character design is great. 
Lots of world to explore and things to collect and more to come.
Co-op mode has been good so far with only a few minutes (wait, at most, to fill a team).
Getting the character you want is challenging but not impossible for F2P players.

Cons;
On mobile to control system isn‚Äôt great. 
It doesn‚Äôt always register the movement of the character and I‚Äôd really like to be able to move or resize the controls. 
I‚Äôve also fired off random character skills when I just meant to jump or pick something up.
Wish there were more useful characters, the guys (apart from Venti and Diluc, neither of which I have) are pretty meh.

There are multiple people in the hundreds if not thousands who have lost the account they‚Äôve worked hard for due to the poor security of the game.

Also this game lags like really bad sometimes, npcs or items dont load in properly, and crashes very often. It also heats up the phone pretty badly, worse than when pokemon go did the same thing. 

Another note is that the rates for characters are abysmally low even for a gacha. Lower than FGO and that‚Äôs really saying something.

Cons:
The only problem with this game is the occasional crashing and the size. My god does this app take up a lot of space, like 10 G! For my phone it occasionally crashes, but since the game auto saves it‚Äôs more of a slight annoyance.

Combat is really fun. The element system is really unique where you have to combo certain elements together to get a reaction.
Gacha rates are low, but to be expected of a gacha-genre game, but the game does not give you a lot of opportunities to get pulls later in the game. 
Game also includes a stamina system to open loot after certain world-boss fights and dungeons. You cam probably do 2-6 before you run out and have to either wait or spend $$$ to continue.

Game is great but i personally think the there needs to be some changes around the stamina system. Playing for 10min and closing the game doesn‚Äôt keep the open-world feel.

  Current Device: IPad Pro 3

However, I am having some serious technical issues.
 - At first, the game seemed a bit buggy, the textures kept tearing and the cinematic lagged behind way too much.
 - Then, the over-world was only lit up in a cone directly in front of just the character model.
 - Next, every objective marker forced the character to become of pure orb of blinding white light that over-lays everything.
 - Finally, after the cinematic for the Storm Terror fight finished, everything disappeared.

  After finishing the fight, completely blind, the over-world has remained completely black. Objective markers still show up and so do menu items; however they are blocked off by every pitch black character model in the way.

-Completely open world (little to no invisible barriers. If you see something, you can go there)

So customizable options would be from skin color to type of hair style and all that would make me and probably others appreciate the game and developers a little more.

Then days later they said I had to repurchase. !!! I‚Äôm not spending another $20! That‚Äôs a ridiculous game feature if that‚Äôs the process, and it doesn‚Äôt say anywhere that I would have to repurchase throughout gameplay!

1891,#FixResinRegen,"Despite the star rating that I have given this review, the game is great! HOWEVER, this game has GLARING ISSUES with a few things.

1- If you are F2P (Free to Play), the amount of Primogems (the currency for the Gacha System) you get will not be enough to get you any of the good characters in a steady way. 
2- Resin has a low cap, and a high refill timer. 120 Resin (the Stamina system that locks you out of specific context) and an 8 minute per 1 Resin refill timer. Once you complete the story quests, the progression comes to a halt because of this system. Only way to refill is to pay with Primogems or with Fragile Resin, which is hard to come by. The Resin system blocks all EXP item grinding, Ascension and Talent materials, and Artifacts.

The trouble is getting it to keep going... while there has been an improvement in crashing (I was previously crashing out of the app every 3-5 minutes and upon opening menus), the game still crashes with alarming frequency and without rhyme or reason.

The first issue is the content drought that comes about 20-30hrs in or so.

The abysmal 5* rates. 0.6% and that‚Äôs between weapons and characters. If you want to Max your character you have to get copies of said character. Even FGO doesn‚Äôt have rates like this.

Even I wouldn‚Äôt spend on the monthly pass because I know there I would only get a chance every 6 months which by then new characters would be out and the meta would change.

So in all, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest this game if you are keen on having the best characters because you will be upwards of $1500USD per 5* character.

It‚Äôs not enough that you get characters through the gaccha system you then have to use resin to farm book to lvl them all up because monsters in the wild give you like 10exp and gold when you need hundreds of thousands of them. It‚Äôs crazy.

6141,teaeggo,"This game is the perfect combination of exploration, storytelling, and collection all in one, wrapped up in an intuitive/easy to learn package. When I downloaded it off of a recommendation I expected another cute phone game that would keep me entertained for a couple hours before realizing there wasn‚Äôt much depth- but it was completely different (it also comes on desktop/console). I got hooked on running around this beautifully built GIANT open map finding secrets, treasures, and fulfilling battles long enough to learn that the story and quest system were also amazingly made. They make play intuitive with goals in the adventurer handbook and constantly reinforce the importance of elemental reactions (which is another feature that makes this game fun and unique). I feel like the game is generous with rewards and I almost never feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äúout‚Äù of crafting materials because they make the gameplay so fun that by the time I go stop running around and exploring I‚Äôll have enough to do some upgrading (level 34 ish atm, I‚Äôm sure it will get harder though) 

*some improvements I‚Äôd like to see* 1- some ways to refresh the current map with new events/adding a new map separate map to travel between to keep things interesting and make me want to keep exploring 2-more ways to play with other people (just like an on/off button on mmorpg style map for regular play) 3-custom main character or access to more characters (which they are working on and releasing now), I also don‚Äôt think it would hurt to allow more wishing gems to be earned, but i understand that they need to make money somehow.

I‚Äôve played through all the main quests for now leaving only some side quests that are too difficult to complete, so I‚Äôm excited for their new updates! Great job!",5,Unexpected new favorite!,2020-11-11 03:42:32,False

At first I wasn‚Äôt sure about getting the app but when I got it it turned out to be better than I expected. In this game you have charters that have unique powers. You go on quests and you find different thing and different creatures that you have to kill. What I mean is not like bloody kill just kill them in like a fighting way with no blood. Anyways overall this game is good. Some things I want the developers to add or remove is that I don‚Äôt like how when you fly,run, or climb it like a timer so you can only do this for an amount of time but it‚Äôs not really a problem but they can add for time. Also I just want the quest to be more detailed. For example sometime the quest is on the bottom or top and when you tap the quest it doesn‚Äôt really clarify where the place is. One more thing is when you do the domain quest there was a quest about fighting the monster or creature under this many seconds. I don‚Äôt really know if this is a problem for others but I find it hard to kill all these creature under this many especially when you kill one and multiple just come again. Also you should probably give the characters shields so they can protect themselves from the monsters. You probably think that this will make the game easier and if you think then you don‚Äôt have change anything this is just my opinion.

6234,FloweryDonut,"A lot of games, mobile or otherwise, have promised open world, or at the very least 3D movability, but have never fully given me the experience of that. The style that this game is set up means that it is not pay to win, and you can get the currency you need quite easily in the game. I haven‚Äôt played much yet, not even done with the first city, but I can tell that I will have an amazing time. My few criticisms are the following: for a game that is entirely open world with very few barriers, I find it hard to believe that mounts aren‚Äôt available. Nothing special, but maybe a horse trader or some sort of magic broom you can ride on? Also, you tend to get duplicate weapons, it would be nice if you could sell things for a profit (I‚Äôm not sure if you can already, I just started). And a few more side quests would be nice. Like if you could help the sick girl, again I just started, so I‚Äôm not sure if any of these are already in the game. Edit: Ok so after a bit more time I have noticed a few more things, the crystals you have to buy are a small amount for about a dollar, if the number of crystals you get could be raised a little then I would pay for the crystals, but for now I can get the same by doing simple quests. Also, if there is a way to find out what to do for the next adventure rank I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. Also, I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT NO LIFE THIS! Pacing yourself makes this so much more enjoyable because you can really take your time and collect everything.",5,The best mobile game I have ever played,2020-10-15 04:18:07,False

6236,TheOriginalHB,"Look, I love this game but here is my dilemma. I downloaded this game on both my iPhone and iPad. On my phone, it works great, they gameplay is wonderful and as mentioned previously I love the game, but on my ipad it‚Äôs a completely different story and I have no idea why, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to find out. On my ipad, the intro screen is black, all of the audio and cut screens glitch and I literally, when I‚Äôm playing the game, can not see more than four feet in front of my character, because it is all surrounded in black abyss. Not only that, sometimes the screen would just go completely black even though it still let me click on the characters and missions and it would still let me fight and play, I just couldn‚Äôt see any of it! (Also whenever I go near a bunch of random things like water, enemies, and chests, this blinding light emits and covers basically the entire screen and I have to go to a certain position or wait for it to go away.) I‚Äôve tried many things to see if it will work and I‚Äôm completely stumped. I don‚Äôt know if this is an issue with my app individually or other people too, I came here to see if anyone can relate. I‚Äôm not going to go on and complain because I understand that an ipad is a privilege and I could just play on my phone, but I prefer my ipad and just want to find out why it‚Äôs doing this. Other than that I think the game is so fun and great and I love the graphics and everything. Just hoping that someone could help me find out what is wrong and possibly a solution.

6286,CoolGamer798,"Great game!!!! The graphics are amazing for just a mobile game and they are absolutely beautiful. The people, the sky, (the monstersüòÇ) but being serious I love this game. It has a wonderful storyline that is also intriguing and is never dull. I also like that if you don‚Äôt want to do the story, you can just explore around the open world map. The characters actually have personalities which I like. All the people are dressed nicely and the clothes and hair and overall clothes very much match the theme and make the game even better. I like that you have freedom to make who you want. You get to choose if your character is a boy or girl and you get to make your own name. I know that isn‚Äôt totally crazy, but I just personally like it. I have only had for two days and I love it. I wouldn‚Äôt want to ruin the game by telling the whole thing about it, but the story is amazing and I love it so so much. You can interact with literally everything and you can do almost anything you want. You can walk, climb, swim, and fly to beautiful destinations. I have seen tall mountains and waterfalls that are amazing. I also like the wildlife that you see around. There are many types of birds that I usually hunt to get food, and there are also many food resources. You can pick fruit from trees, get fruit form bushes on the ground, hunt animals, and you can literally cook!!! I love that so much because I like to cook anywhere and everywhere all the time. Here are the bad things about the game: I can‚Äôt get enough of it and I want to play moreeeeee!!!!!!!!! Should be way way way way way way way way way way way longer!!! More awesome characters!!!!!!!!!! I am writing this completely on my own and I was not paid to write a good review. I hope this helps to people that are thinking about downloading. Here is my overall suggestion of if you should play it. 9/10 I say you should get the game 9/10 is what I would get it. I only went down one because it is super addicting and once you start, you won‚Äôt be able to stop until you have had enough of this game ( which is impossible considering how fun and interesting and amazing this game truly is) I am sorry that this was so long but to everyone that read the whole entire thing, Congrats ü•≥ üéâ üëè!!!

6383,Baka_Bear,"I was wary at first... a Chinese gacha game with character additions and a focus on making the characters cute? Surely it was a scam.
Then I decided to give it a try after my cousin got me to give it a shot. I was still skeptical for a while, but as I started to play it, I learned that the gacha themes were more-so something that you could truly choose to participate in if you felt like it. They weren‚Äôt mandatory in any way. The game itself stands strong on its own and could easily be one of, if not the best mobile games out there. My only complaint is the targeting system that they have. In the mobile game it‚Äôs understandable, but through the mobile game or the PC version it‚Äôs not toggleable and can be pretty frustrating when you can‚Äôt play around with what you want to aim at. If there was a way to turn it off or better yet, change targets, it would be a near flawless game for what it‚Äôs intention was.

Overall, I‚Äôm greatly impressed with how the game turned out. The gacha elements are entirely for you to decide if you want to put your money towards it as everything can be done just as well with whatever characters and weapons you‚Äôve obtained naturally. While using the gacha aspects may make things easier for you, given that it‚Äôs a single player focused game, there‚Äôs no real incentive to go out of your way and throw money at the game unless you don‚Äôt want to face any challenges. Even then, the advantage you get from utilizing the gacha aren‚Äôt so impactful that you‚Äôll breeze through things, rather some of the characters are just slightly better and therefore do have an advantage, which doesn‚Äôt feel as though you need to have them to succeed as there is no competitive or PvP oriented aspect.",5,A lot better than I thought.,2020-11-02 02:26:39,False

6398,abbb4,"To start off the exploration is just like botw there are puzzles scattered everywhere that give rewards also chests and teleport waypoints so you might get side tracked a lot. Now the combat is different from botw because it encourages you to change characters and use elemental reactions. Like mixing water and ice which makes enemys freeze or mixing electric and fire to make explosions. Every character has a element their is 7 in total pyro, cyro, electro, anemo, dendro, geo, and water. Now there is a lot of grinding you have to do unless you‚Äôre p2w but if your f2p you can still do a lot of things that p2w people can do but a little bit slower. The gacha won‚Äôt guarantee you what you want and people get mad because of that but you don‚Äôt have to spend any money to use the gacha so it‚Äôs not something to get mad about. If you use money that‚Äôs on you but don‚Äôt get mad at the game when you don‚Äôt get that one character you wanted because it‚Äôs all your fault. Now there are many bugs but that‚Äôs not their fault I mean it‚Äôs a game they usually have bugs. But there is a lot of game breaking ones like enemies in walls enemies that are invisible and bosses that don‚Äôt work how they‚Äôre supposed to. I barely scratched the surface but like I said you can‚Äôt blame them. I had this one really bad glitch where I had a black screen and when I went into the game I could only see one chunk ahead of me, but I switched to a better device and it works fine. people complain about how their device is bad and doesn‚Äôt support the game then give one star. I mean it‚Äôs a open world game your device is just not cut out for it. So please don‚Äôt give one stars without thinking. Be able to play then rate. Last thing Mihoyo please bring controller support that would make more people play but don‚Äôt hurry because you‚Äôll mess it up that way.

Many open world games have multiple problems of engaging the player. However, Mihoyo refines many of the good elements from open world games and implements it into a game that can be played on your phone and other platforms. It is definitely similar to Breath of the Wild from Nintendo on the Nintendo Switch but maintains its personal identity through different mechanics that is immediately introduced to you. Such as elemental combinations, it allows a wide variety and a new fresh take on combat. You can take a character that uses hydro such as Barbara and combo with an ice user such as Kaeya to freeze your enemies and monsters. With many more other combinations which give an addictive and satisfying experience. While there are many positive aspects, there are also many cons. You will need to heavily grind in the game to continue to story which can be extremely time consuming and there are bosses which consume stamina/energy which takes a day to recharge to reap the rewards. On the plus side the bosses can be fought even without the energy and rewards but take time to respawn. The game is still a gacha game and you must roll for different characters who wield different abilities and obtaining every character is definitely very expensive as retrieving ‚Äúprimogems‚Äù are tiring and very lacking. There remains an option to purchase primogems, however, if you are a free-to-play person this is not an option. In the end, this game is very well designed with minimal flaws that can be easily ignored, especially for a free-to-play game. 9/10",5,Worth your time!,2020-11-11 04:39:50,False

6654,uncanny sponge,"Never in my mobile gaming experience have I ever enjoyed a game so much to the point that I actually write a review about it. This is my first review, and I can confidently say the game being reviewed is a big success. Genshin impact has only been out for a few days and the amount of bugs and glitches I have experienced are minimal to a freaky level. Every time I venture into a mission in the story or a side quest, I am able to understand everything that is going on. In many adventure games like Genshin, the campaign can sometimes get confusing with its fantastical and fictional elements, but when I play Genshin impact I have no problem with that issue. In fact, I believe the campaign is flawless in many aspects. In addition, the multiplayer/co-op mode is just as astounding. I love easily joining my friends and the gameplay not being affected either. In light of the current situation of multiplayer, I only have two suggestions: I should be able to continue missions or talk to NPC characters while in multiplayer mode. I understand the missions being unavailable to co-op because there are probably multiple obstacles like level, cut scenes, etc, but I feel that one feasible change is enabling discussion between NPCs in multiplayer. My phone battery also goes down fast, but I can‚Äôt expect that to change because it‚Äôs PS4 and PC game running on mobile (which it does very well). Although I gave a few suggestions previously, I am completely satisfied and could wish for nothing more than the gameplay I am getting now. I wrote the review to bring this game‚Äôs greatness to light, and I hope that I encouraged some people to try this game out.",5,Enjoying it enough to actually rate...,2020-10-04 03:46:05,False

6656,Aelrick,"To start off: I normally don‚Äôt leave reviews for mobile games. Mainly because I get bored easily and put them off. The last game I remember reviewing was Vainglory and that is because I had spent countless hours playing it as it is a really fun moba. Now, this game kept popping up on my Facebook feed before its release and I did the preorder just to give it a chance; I enjoyed watching the ad and the graphics looked fun and pleasing to the eyes. Now, as I started playing the game on my phone since its release, I‚Äôve come to find that not only are visuals gorgeous, but the world gives so much to admire and enjoy. The music is sweet and gives the world character, the combat system and the ability to switch between your favorite characters and their elements to create combos and strategic thinking in battle gave me a rush that I rarely get from mobile games. I work in pest control and one of the customers I was serving was playing this game on PlayStation and we were able to discuss the beauty that is this game. The dialogue and voice acting is good and the game constantly feels very rewarding. I explore and I am rewarded for doing so and I am constantly upgrading my characters and their weapons. The developers have done an amazing job with this game and I look forward to seeing what it brings as I continue to spend hours on it. It isn‚Äôt a cash grabbing game since all forms of currency are easily accessible through gameplay even though I will say that if you decide to put money down, go ahead because this company has earned any money they receive to fund more content and for the amazing work they have done.",5,Amazing,2020-10-02 01:17:32,False

6766,CrossSing,"This game is honestly so amazing, it has wonderful characters and the open world is just fantastic and I have never been so addicted to a game since Fortnite s7 but that‚Äôs beside the point and the other reason i decided to finally write this review was to warn new players about some of the stuff they may come across, for example once you have hit AR(Adventure Rank) 28+ you might encounter problems that players have been raving about: the Resin System and Character Drop rates(this one doesn‚Äôt matter for any rank). For starters, right now at the moment( remember that) the max amount of resin you have is 120 which as you get farther into the game will realize that 120 is clearly not enough and then the time to replenish that resin is 1:8 ratio 1 resin is 8 minutes, that means you have to wait at least 16 hrs for all your resin to be replenished, I personally is not that bothered by this problem only a little bit, but a lot others are and time to address the next problem which is Character Drop rates, I might be a tad bit biased for this one but the character drop rates are ridiculously low. For example getting a 5 star character is 0.6% and you have to wish 90 TIMES just get guaranteed 5 star and that is a very HUGE problem for the community because it makes a very large gap between the f2p(Free to play) and ptw(pay to win) players because people who spend money have a more likely chance of getting these amazing 5 star characters while f2p‚Äôs barely have a chance and have to grind and save like crazy. A solution I do have for the resin problem is to one increase the cap not to 160 but at least 180 and decrease the replenish time to at least 2:1 ratio(2 min = 1 resin) and introduce a resin mechanic called Condensed Resin because this will one. Allow players to play more and grind way more and not get hit by a resin wall. Two. Will also help people saves their fragile resin till at least AR 40+ and three. This will make more people play a lot more than just dailies everyday and a side note is plz mihoyo increase the drop rates of the characters and INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PRIMOGEMS U GET IN GAME(new players will learn about primogems once they play) but all in all this a very great game and one of the best gachas out there so far and I don‚Äôt want anyone to quit because of the problems I stated here, All I‚Äôm trying to do is make new players aware of these problems so it won‚Äôt be such a big shocker when it hits them and I hope you guys enjoyed the review and keep doing your work mihoyo and I‚Äôll see you in gameüëã",5,Amazing Game but things to be wary of,2020-10-25 00:41:15,False

6778,Parent review person,"Ok so i‚Äôm just going to start out with saying i know this is a long review but just stay with me üòÇ. Ok, this game is so amazing and beautiful! The world and the story and the characters are all just so breathtaking and this game was DEFINITELY worth the wait. And also ive read a lot of the reviews and i‚Äôm just going to start with clarifying some things. For starters, this game is 100% free to play. Yes there is an option to buy things and it is hard to get certain characters but the developers and SUPER generous with giving you the materials you would need to get those characters! and to all those people who are saying ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs only a 0.6% chance you‚Äôll get a 5 star character this game is trash.‚Äù ... well they‚Äôre kind of wrong... What they don‚Äôt understand is that there are things called events and they will change every so often and if your patient and wait for new events you could get one that would up your chance for getting a character you want! And i haven‚Äôt spent any money and just with the materials that the devs have provided i already have qiqi AND Venti on one of my accounts so i got lucky! So just keep playing if you want to get a certain character, that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm doing for mona and sucrose üòÇ. Also some people are saying that they‚Äôve finished the game and there‚Äôs nothing else to do... well that is totally incorrect and this is not just a treasure chest opening simulator! The developers will add new areas and new things to do every update and they will also add new amazing characters and stories!!! (or so i‚Äôve been told) but i‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the deal. and the last thing i‚Äôm going to say is that just so you know this game is a lot like botw,  it‚Äôs similar bc it has  lots of the same battle tactics and  gameplay aspects but the story itself is totally different so if u enjoyed botw as much as i did then u will prob like this game, it‚Äôs like botw gameplay with different characters and story and world üòÇ. Some ppl get mad bc of how similar they are and i agree that they are reallllyyyy similar but that doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. So with clearing up all that stuff, this game is phenomenal and it is free to play! i would defiantly recommend this is anyone and pretty much any age group! (Also at the begging of the story u get to choose if u want to be a girl or boy and that was so cool!)  Thank you developers for such an amazing game!!

6800,SgtPickls,"Ok, I haven‚Äôt written a lot of game reviews, but this absolutely deserves a commendation. Getting started you‚Äôre immediately thrown into this what looks like Breath of the Wild world but with hints of anime. The art is amazing, the gameplay is really smooth, there‚Äôs tons of exploration, once you get looking the map is pretty huge, it‚Äôs cross-platform and tons of other great things. It can be a tiny bit confusing at first to get used to but once you take a look at things, you get that hang of it real quick. 
I‚Äôve played for a few hours probably now and I‚Äôm 100% in love with every aspect of this. For those who enjoy anime and were looking for something anime-esc, this is definitely a must play. You can change the language voiceovers to Japanese, or keep it English if you prefer, but Voiceover Audio and Game Language are different, so you can play with English but listen in Japanese. 
I‚Äôm having a great time with this. It‚Äôs something everyone can play and enjoy together, especially with co-op. They even give you enough starting rewards to get going with new things and/or characters to start. (At least for early players) I‚Äôm looking forward to what‚Äôs in store from these developers. They seem like they‚Äôre definitely interested and in touch with their community and I can see this taking off.

6959,Totototototptggtdcbh,"I immediately started playing the minute it launched, and I was taken back for the first time. This game is absolutely stunning. The graphics are top-notch, and the animation is very smooth. On top of that, the world is very open and very detailed. The landscapes are sprawling an beautiful. My only animosity with that idea is that the player can‚Äôt go into areas deemed ‚Äútoo dangerous.‚Äù It could be more interesting if the player could still access these areas, giving it a ‚Äúmore risk = more reward‚Äù kind of feel. But this isn‚Äôt too bad and overwhelming, so the player can still access the world almost completely freely. The mechanics of this game are a mix of many hit games, and combines them in the best way possible. Each character has their own weapon and moves, and you can glide around the winds like a bird. I especially like the cooking system in this game. I found it very rewarding. Searching in every nook and cranny also rewarded me with many good early-game goodies, which I enjoyed. I also found that talking to some npcs netted me some mid-level gear all the way in the beginning too. The gacha system is also really cool, and I enjoyed it. The only concern about it for new players is that you will get more weapons than characters. I like the mix in class variants for the characters too. 

In all, this game introduces some really amazing concepts for the world of mobile gaming, and I feel it could pioneer a new era if this is pulled off right, and it gets the attention it deserves.

7161,LordLucas1407,"First off, as someone who has playedmany MMO RPGS on all platforms I have to say this is by far my favorite. 
We all know how much we hated the close to 0%  chances of unlocking anything good in any game, or how the combat system just didn‚Äôt make sense. Well that‚Äôs not the case anymore here. In this game EVERY character is bound to be useful on your team. You are not BOUND by any OP team comp or OP character anymore. The elemental combat system makes sure ALL characters can play off of each other in such a satisfying way. Of an enemy is wet they will be frozen with next ice attack OR attacks will do chain damage if hit with lightning damage. Burning enemies can be vaporized with water damage or overcharged with electric damage. Every character works on pretty much every team, thus nullifying that ‚Äúugh who do I have to get rid of to use this hero effectively‚Äù feeling. The best part is: it isn‚Äôt even hard to unlock more heroes. They have a perfect chance of coming out of a roll, with the game gives you plenty of. Not only this but the move sets of all characters are amazing. The fact that you can use any character a different way depending on what environment you‚Äôre in BLOWS me away. I must say the experience is much better on PC or console since this game is MASSIVE. Another pro of this game is that it is MASSIVE. There is just SOOOOO much to do that you‚Äôre not bound by any of those boring RPG rules where you have to grind to no avail to get anywhere. You are set to explore a good portion of the world right from the start. The game doesn‚Äôt hold you hand to the phony where it tells you EVERYTHING but it gives you a fantastic and helpful idea of what‚Äôs going on when it happens. For example when you do an elemental combo the game will give you the OPTION to check and see what on earth you just did to eradicate that enemy. Unlike other RPGs where you have to spam a button to get over the boring introductions and tutorials, you get the option to explore the games extremely diverse combat system and enviro engagement. You can literally set the ground of fire and create and updraft (just like breath of the wild) or set shields on fire. The game even gives you a mechanic to see what objects can be effected by what element without overwhelming the player with information.

7188,zombieraichu,"First, I must say that I‚Äôm not one to usually enjoy ‚Äúgacha‚Äù games. Now, I have an exception to the rule that‚Äôs not only fun, but provides a beautiful and immersive experience. On top of that, the entire game can be played not only as a free to play title that entices you to dump hundreds of dollars into it, but also as I have played it: without spending a single penny. That game is Genshin Impact.

My boss and a few of my coworkers had been hounding me to try this game for weeks, and told me how spectacular it was from the getgo. Usually I wouldn‚Äôt trust such brash statements on a game, but my boss is quite the picky gamer. On that I decided to download the game onto iOS, as I don‚Äôt currently have access to PC or PS4. Once I installed the game and went through it‚Äôs relatively lengthy download time, I was greeted to something I knew was possible on mobile, but I never expected a team to actually pull it off. The world, while unfinished, was absolutely massive. On top of that, it was also gorgeous! As I took my first steps into the world of Teyvat, I quickly realized the game‚Äôs heavy inspiration from the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, the second I unlocked a second character to play with, this similarity was smashed into pieces. The combat in this game is very unique, and if you like constantly changing strategies to take on different enemies... this is 100% the game for you. The only thing left I would want to gush about is the story... but... that would lead to spoilers, which I couldn‚Äôt fathom doing with such an enticing storyline. My only complaint in this game is Paimon. As a supporting character she would have been great, but the decision to have a mostly silent protagonist leads to her taking up the vast majority of player sided dialogue in the game. This would be okay, if her voice wasn‚Äôt annoying in literally every language. Overall, 9.9/10, too much Paimon, like Skyrim with Guns (last one there is a joke)

7383,Phrecia,"This contains minor spoilers.
Since you can already see the star rating, I‚Äôm going to list my main complaint at the top: the dialogue. The disconnect between the voice lines and the subtitles can be really disconcerting - I especially noticed it during the Xiangling‚Äôs Cookoff quest. What, did you just... not give the subtitle-ers the same script the VAs read off of? Or were the VAs given something different from what the translators wrote? Very strange. Also, the gender switch-ups. I chose the girl twin, and Venti says at the end of the tutorial about ‚Äúfinding my sister,‚Äù when it‚Äôs my brother that I‚Äôm after. I think Jean also referred to me as ‚Äúhe‚Äù to Diluc the first time we all met up, although I could be misremembering. Anyway, given all the times I‚Äôve been gendered correctly in previous voiced dialogue or just been given something gender neutral (traveler, cutie, honorary knight etc.) I have to wonder why it was decided to be wrong at this moment/these moments. Really immersion breaking. Sadly, dialogue never ever gets fixed in games with these problems. Perhaps we‚Äôre just lucky to get correct lines for the girl twin at all, especially since the fairytale cutscene after defeating Dvalin shows the prince having to rescue the princess, indicating the boy twin is canon.

As for the praise, this is an excellent port. I completely forgive this game for heating up my phone enough that holding it is painful. Tons of freedom of movement and direction, good characterization. Paimon being a companion/guide that‚Äôs actually endearing instead of insufferable amazes me. I also enjoy that it‚Äôs not afraid to get dark like with the guy in Liyue whose parents got murdered. The controls are solid, though maaaybe the glider could be a little more responsive in opening, or maybe I‚Äôm just bad. Combat and puzzles beat the normal slog of just bashing away through element interaction, rewarding proper character usage. Though, the larger enemies do feel like damage sponges - mainly the wind orb (though I‚Äôll admit to forgetting to give Amber a better weapon) and the second kind of big robot, the one that levitates and moves quickly and ruins your HP bar. Anyway, sorry for the long read. I really enjoy playing this game. I just wish miHoYo didn‚Äôt get lazy with the dialogue, because of all the things that make an RPG that‚Äôs what never gets touch-ups.",5,"wonderful experience, classic dialogue issues",2020-10-02 06:01:10,False

7407,cactishroud,"First off let me say I LOVE THIS GAME. The graphics, the story, the flexibility and creativity that I‚Äôve experienced is phenomenal and made very meticulously. HOWEVER, others might agree with me on this, it‚Äôs expensive. A 10 pull is essentially 25$ and even then it‚Äôs not guaranteed you‚Äôll pull a character. For instance I saved enough for 3 consecutive pulls only to get majority 3* weapon, 2 4* weapon and one 4 star character, sure you can earn it for free but the primo gems gets scarcer as the plot line progresses and you have to spend significantly more time to farm for both books and currencies. The exp you get from monsters are so scarce that it makes it impossible to level a character quickly based on battles alone. Not only that I have slowly begun experiencing increased crashes and lag in game, usually during a large battle on one of my quests which I end up having to redo. All in all I love this game but the level of time and effort you need to level your characters and complete quests as you progress further in game isn‚Äôt proportional, the rewards should increase but it doesn‚Äôt or hardly does. Not only that but the only way you get primo gems and fragile resin is pretty limited to quests and purchase, unlike most other games which have a calendar advent that allows you to gain some rewards via monthly daily login. I love this game but it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to enjoy as i progress since I have other irl stuff that just doesn‚Äôt allow me enough to time a day to progress satisfactorily even though it did in the beginning.

7750,Riverflower,"I love this game. The open world concept really makes it fun to explore while grinding out missions and the battle system is satisfying. I also like the option where you aren‚Äôt necessarily forced to go at the story pace. If I was to take a break, I can just go off exploring at my own pace, so it‚Äôs relaxing. I don‚Äôt even care if it‚Äôs a gacha game. The experience makes it enjoyable enough for me to become addicted to it. 

However, there is a LOT of crashing. I use an iPad (6th generation) that is compatible with the game. I lowered my graphics settings to thr lowest available and have plenty of storage on my device. On average, it crashes 2-3 times per 30 minutes. I appreciate that the game saves data so I don‚Äôt have to redo something important, but the crashes irritate me and really interrupts the gameplay. ItKs even worse that I crash in the middle of co-op boss battles, so at this point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an option for me. I‚Äôm aware that there are plenty of other people who have crashes like me, so if you can find a way to fix the crashes I‚Äôd highly appreciate it!

The final thing I‚Äôd like to address is co-op. While it‚Äôs cool to be able to join your friends in their worlds, you‚Äôre pretty limited in what you can do. As of now, it‚Äôs really only helping your friends grind for materials, though not being a party leader, you can‚Äôt progress yourself. Even as a party leader, I cannot unlock new nodes to teleport to, meaning anything storywise is frozen(I understand why story-related options are closed off in this mode, but I think should be okay to let players go into story dungeons if you already completed it.) If anything, I feel like its limits make me rather drop co-op and just continue singleplayer. Co-op doesn‚Äôt really take away from the game, but I feel it has more potential if implemented well.",4,"Great, but crashes/co-op issues",2020-10-13 16:27:53,False

The downside is that while I can see that they don‚Äôt want people to burn through the game content, advancement is painfully slow. One way they can fix this is by doubling the Adventure Rank Exp you receive or reduce the amount needed to level up slightly. Not only that but there is a limited loot pool so far and it kinda ruins the grind of getting the same things over and over. I should feel rewarded for taking on tough bosses, however I just don‚Äôt once I get the loot. Also the whole wish system is a bit of a downer if you don‚Äôt get lucky off the start or you don‚Äôt pay. For free, casual players, at least give everybody a free one wish everyday or something. Don‚Äôt lock characters behind weeks of building of currency just to get tons of low tier loot. Give us something to look forward to logging in. Also, why not add armor pieces and pets maybe? Weapon and armor accessories to customize your character would go such a long way. As it stands, characters are basic besides the weapons. Make us WANT to adventure. Make us WANT to go try and solo a hard boss fight. A little more game progress would help a lot with this game. Add more guild bounties. Add a server boss for all regions and compete for damage and exclusive rewards based of damage, final hit on boss, etc. this game has tons of potential, I just hope the developers can make this amazing.

The voice acting is great, story so far is interesting, gameplay is top tier even for a console or PC which makes sense since it‚Äôs on those platforms. On top of all this though, what gets me even more excited to play this game, is the UI in it!! It is BEAUTIFUL! A lot of games REALLY mess up the UI and don‚Äôt put much thought into it, but the UI in this game is simplistic with elegance and it runs SMOOTH. It doesn‚Äôt skip around when I‚Äôm scrolling through items or announcements! I think the UI in these games is almost ALWAYS overlooked! The ONLY issue I have with it though, is a big one. As I can tell A LOT of effort and hard work went into this game, it‚Äôs BLATANTLY OBVIOUS that not much thought went into it. I didn‚Äôt think it was going to be as bad as I heard, but it is. This game is most definitely a LoZ:Breath of the Wild clone, and it REALLY gets to me! At first I didn‚Äôt mind that they took some aspects from the game because I‚Äôd LOVE to see the gameplay aspects from LoZ:BotW to be in some other open world games. They just make sense to be in open world rpg games. Like the climbing, the elemental reactions, the shrines for fast travel. There‚Äôs a point where it goes from inspiration... to a clone though. And that‚Äôs exactly what happened with this game. All in all though, I REALLY like the game. I gave it a 4-star SOLEY for the reason it‚Äôs a clone.

8362,AyooAlcaideee,"Visuals, Story, Graphics, Characters, and the Gameplay are all extraordinary. The only drawback is the Free to Play experience, and with it is the grind or give up play style. You either like this game so much to spend money or not enough and just play it as it is. The Characters you get should not start off at level 1 and instead start at what world level you‚Äôre at. For example if you‚Äôre world level 4 then your characters that you get from your wish should atleast be level 30 or something you find acceptable. The resin system is also something that‚Äôs holding this game back, with only 120 per recharge instead of something like 300 or maybe even 400. With an increase in resin capacity then the grind for this game may be worth it. Please don‚Äôt let your greed be your downfall MiHoYo as this game is beyond superb. After playing for a month I‚Äôve realized that these improvement changes are worth it for your supporters and  will make your game better than it ever was. World levels play a role in enemies why not your wished characters that you get and make the level up system for the characters worth it for the world level starting system. And the Gacha style wishing... man oh man the characters are amazing but the chances to get them? Not even close to what I was expecting. We only get trials and that barely makes up for what we grind for in this game the amount of time I put into this doesn‚Äôt reflect what I should be able to get. 5 star characters per 90 wishes is absurd and shows your greed for this game. Games are meant to be fun and enjoyable for everyone and not just give advantages for people who have money since the 5 star characters need 90 wishes to be able to be acquired.",3,Amazing Game with Room for improvement,2020-10-25 19:43:14,False

8507,Briiellebee,"If you have a PC or a PS4, the game is much better on either. The mobile version is the same, but it will overheat your phone and drain your battery, so I recommend the other platforms over this one. It also currently lacks controller support, so it‚Äôs a much better experience when you aren‚Äôt on a small touchscreen. 

That being said, I had to drop a star due to a recent discovery. There are things in place meant to intentionally cripple the progress of those trying to play for free. The battle pass mission use 1600 resin is impossible to complete without spending primogems, which players save up to use for the Gacha. I‚Äôm sure they are aware that they‚Äôve done this and it‚Äôs meant to corner you into spending money. This is no longer some crappy mobile game. It‚Äôs a PC and PS4 game, so I suggest the developers stop treating it like a mobile game and using these type of tactics. Either it‚Äôs free to play or it isn‚Äôt. Not to mention the EXTREMELY low chances of drawing new characters. I have only managed to draw two characters that weren‚Äôt free. I keep getting four star weapons that I don‚Äôt even own enough characters to use. Please make it so that we can earn more characters by playing. This game has already raked in millions from whales alone, I‚Äôm sure you can afford to throw us a few more characters that we can earn through gameplay.

I was also forced to leave my review for the game here due to the feedback page on PS4 not functioning. There are also many bugs that need to be worked out, such as random boss resets that greatly hinder progress as well. Imagine having almost killed a boss when it suddenly starts to ignore you, walks back to its original position, and resets to full health. While some bosses do regenerate health on their own, I assure you that that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. I am also not leaving the ‚Äúboss area‚Äù either. There‚Äôs also the issue of getting stuck in chairs and the Paimon push. Paimon will forcefully push you out of a red zone. However, she will often push you off a cliff or, occasionally, into a crevice. I was forced into a rock crevice and unable to get out due to Paimon repeatedly pushing me back into it and forced to teleport somewhere else, which resulted in a long walk back. Get rid of the Paimon push. Just put up an invisible wall. I already hate Paimon for being an annoying little demon. Don‚Äôt make me hate her even more.",3,Don‚Äôt download the mobile game.,2020-10-06 14:25:38,False

8533,Gig jinn,"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a 5 star game early game. But I‚Äôve been playing since launch and have reached endgame content. It‚Äôs become pretty boring with almost nothing to do every day. From early to mid game there‚Äôs constant content with missions and storyline quests but as soon as you hit endgame it becomes a barren wasteland. Like it‚Äôs to the point where I check in for 30 mins every day to collect rewards and use up my energy (resin) and be done with the entire day. There‚Äôs literally nothing else to do. On top of that drops and money (mora) doesn‚Äôt scale with endgame content. But apparently leveling and ascension materials do, so it‚Äôs becoming a ridiculous grind to level anything. But I don‚Äôt mind grinding but only for the stuff that‚Äôs actually useful. I don‚Äôt want to run around the entire map and wipe the mobs on my farming routes to end up with a surplus in ascension mats for characters I don‚Äôt even have and almost no artifacts to power up my good ones and so few mora that it‚Äôs not even worth it. Therefore I think the BIGGEST setback for this game is the RESIN(energy) system. Either that or add so many quests that we need to do that we can‚Äôt finish them. I honestly think the entire system should be removed or just give us a ridiculous amount of condensed resin so we just never run out unless we‚Äôre literally farming for an entire day. Like I want to be able to play for a few hours and actually enjoy the game and not be limited by some stupid energy limit the devs put in the game. Most games with systems like that I don‚Äôt even bother playing or getting good since you can never catch up to whoever started earlier than you or whaled the game.",3,Fun for the beginning,2020-11-09 06:44:00,False

8883,Aqwplayer soccers,"This game is really interesting as you roam between the two regions like Monstadt and Liyue. Music is decent, graphics are great and mechanics in this game simple. 

I don‚Äôt know about other phones but my iPhone tends to overheat without a fan blowing it. This game is enjoyable even if you don‚Äôt have 5* but when you get one, it does help you feel more excited for adventure. I love exploring and solve mini puzzles. I love how having 4* is enough to get jobs done and not meta required. So far I‚Äôm kinda f2p but I bought the monthly rewards for some primo gems and to support the game that is somehow free $$$. Hope y‚Äôall play for the game itself and not just for the characters. I mean it‚Äôs cool to obtain such awesome characters but the downside is when you don‚Äôt get what you want. You automatically don‚Äôt feel like playing the game anymore. Even I went through this stage of sadness and depressed not getting my waifus but gotta manage. This game is time consuming and I spent like 6-10 hours on it everyday. Oh and you gotta be observant. Right now I might not see the cons because of how beautiful this game is. 

P2W doesn‚Äôt exist in here, it‚Äôs rather pay to play as f2p can accomplish such goals too but a bit slower. People pay to obtain weapons and characters. Imo those who are paying are doing us f2p a favor, that is supporting the game especially when it‚Äôs free. The concept of winner and loser simply doesn‚Äôt exist in this world. There‚Äôs no pvp but rather coop, helping each other or friends out is the main goal of coop. Don‚Äôt stress yourself out for not getting the 5* you wanted, you‚Äôll get them in the future as it only takes patience. Thank you to those reading this and supporting the game much love <3.",3,So far,2020-10-02 00:34:43,False

I only play on mobile to collect daily rewards or to use up some resin (used to claim rewards from activities in the game) if I‚Äôm near my cap and won‚Äôt be able to do stuff on PC. Whenever I‚Äôm fighting monsters, the game just lags a lot, especially if there‚Äôs a lot of reactions on the field and makes it hard to not die. I‚Äôll also randomly get crashes I freezes, not during combat, but just doing things like walking around the map, opening menus or talking to an NPC.

Other gripes ‚Äî this is a gacha game so there‚Äôs obviously lots of things you can buy to progress. The first 30-35 levels, there really isn‚Äôt any need to buy anything as what you get from progressing through the story and quests and dailies gets you through that without too much difficulty. After that though, it becomes really hard to improve your characters because you just can‚Äôt get enough resources, even if you do pay money as the amount you get per dollar is absolutely terrible. Even whales who have spent thousands on the game are struggling which is quite telling. It feels bad to spend on this game because you‚Äôd expect your money to get you somewhere and make the game more enjoyable, but the price ratio is too high right now. Of course, there‚Äôs a lot more content promised, but I don‚Äôt know when that content is going to come. It could be several months or even years and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll wait around that long.

9028,Harm.lynn,"I started this game only a few weeks ago and im already addicted!  I love the graphics, the characters, The quests, and not to mention the amazing storyline! I think the best part about it is that it‚Äôs easy to gain XP and level up but just hard enough so where you're not finishing the game in the first week, it's a perfect balance! I also love the fact that since some parts of the story are only accessible to certain levels, you can still do side quests, and go hunting (Animals or monsters!) that way you're not stuck doing anything the entire time with no way to level up! I really only have a few complaints, which, honestly are just recommendations! 

-I think it would be awesome if with the characters with swords were able to jump from the ground and pull our weapons out midair, instead of having to climb up something and then jump off to attack.

-Another thing I would recommend is maybe having a chat for Co-Op mode? It‚Äôs kinda strange being to join other people's servers but having no clue what's going on and not being able to communicate with them.

-It would also be nice if some things were explained a little further when you unlocked them, for example, when I unlocked Co-Op mode all it told was if I clicked this button I could join other servers, and I couldn‚Äôt do quests while in Co-Op mode, but is there a way to invite people to my servers? Can I lock my server so people can‚Äôt even request to join? Just small things like that would make the game a lot more enjoyable!

-Please come put with a Switch version!I have a Nintendo Switch and I think it would be absolutely amazing to be able to play on an actual console! 

And that's really it! Thank you for taking the time to read this and for making such an awesome game! Have an amazing day/night!",5,Absolutely  Amazing!! (Just a few recommendations!),2020-11-24 18:53:55,False

9041,FracturedWorlds,"The game itself is great, I have played many hours on pc issue is that it didn‚Äôt open when I trued to play for the first time. It came up as a white screen while I waited a few minutes and then not being happened.
Besides that I feel like multiplayer need a little bit of a change.
Things I would love to see implemented would be a lower level multiplayer to level together at a slower rate then normal because of the speed at which you can progress and an increased difficulty when having more players. In ties to the multiplayer standards I would like to see some quest be available in multiplayer. Also merchants and data should be able to be tracked over to multiplayer. And for one of the biggest things is the chest system to fix it just have any chest that the non host player has found shown as an open chest to them but an unopened one for the host who hasn‚Äôt opened it yet. With these things implemented it should help the multiplayer part of the community to grow allowing possibly multiplayer events to be available and wanted by parts of the community. 
Final issue to address with having a high level and going to lower world level multiplayer game to make it easier for them it will make it hard to implement this but to counter this just have a max cap per level the host is to be applied for the non-host player who is of much higher level. This would allow for a at possibly worst case scenario a 90% decrease In most stats making the level 30 or higher a comparable to a level 3 or so when working with a level 1 or something.

TL:DR 
Great game but multiplayer is a bit annoying
Issues was higher level people playing with a low level host so to fix it would be to debuff the higher level player by a percentage of all stats, increased difficulty when playing any level with more people, allowing quest to be multiplayer, allowing loot from unopened chest to be picked up by only the player who opened it to let multiplayer non-host be able to get loot with out stealing it, and allowing for transition of items and characters between you and your friends worlds",5,I love this game but there are a few problems,2020-10-17 05:49:53,False

9075,ashanty100,"When I started playing this game, it was amazing and I was right off the back addicted to it 
I still am addicted to it however there are some things that bother me a bit
1. The further you get into the game, the more you start lacking mora, I wish there was an easier way to get mora, even 100k Mora isn‚Äôt enough when it comes to ascending, leveling up,etc 
2. Primo gems are a bit hard to get when you‚Äôre f2p, I can understand why Primo gems shouldn‚Äôt be extremely easy to get since this is a gacha game but I wish there was a better way to get primo gems, getting like 1 primo gem per every chest you open doesn‚Äôt help at all and that new hilichurl that has a chance to drop 1 primo gem doesn‚Äôt help at all either.
3. I wish there was some sort of relationship system, kind of like having actual conversations with characters, kind of like the friendship thing that‚Äôs in the game but better. A lot of people have waifu‚Äôs and husbando‚Äôs that are in this game so it would be pretty cool if there was a way to interact with them more with friendship quests or maybe even getting special cut-scenes with them depending on your relationship level with them. Kind of like a ""dating"" system or just a system that allows you to become close friends with a character. This is just something I would want to be added to this game but it isn‚Äôt really necessary :).

9085,GamesByNik,"I‚Äôm a big fan of these types of games, however I always struggled to find one that was captivating for more than a week or two. I‚Äôve been playing this game for almost two months and I still make an effort to log in and play at least an hour, sometimes more (depending on my free time), every day. I‚Äôll list out the pros and cons though.

Pros:
- The storyline is captivating and it progresses as you level up your adventure rank, and there are tons of side quests, dungeons and bosses you can partake in the meantime.
-The world is so open and free, you‚Äôre not bound to specific areas and you‚Äôre pretty much free to explore. Even when you are bound to certain areas, it‚Äôs typically in the early game when you‚Äôre not quite ready to venture too far into the world yet. You don‚Äôt even have to do the main storyline (although I really recommend that you do, it‚Äôs interesting and opens up more of the world as you progress), you can explore, do side quests, gather resources for cooking or leveling up.
-The graphics are beautiful! Typically Mobile game graphics aren‚Äôt the best, especially if it‚Äôs a free game, but I was honestly amazed. My boyfriend isn‚Äôt into mobile games and doesn‚Äôt play, but when he sneaks peeks at my phone while I‚Äôm playing he always remarks at how great the graphics are.
-You don‚Äôt need to spend money in game to progress. That‚Äôs the best part imo. Once you reach a certain adventure rank, you have to option to spend money on in game currency, but it‚Äôs not necessary unless you want it. The game provides multiple ways to get a surplus of coins and wishing stars by ranking up, doing quests, and giving you lots of in-game items that you can use to purchase more coins. The game also gives you different hero‚Äôs throughout as you complete quests, and it gives you in-game items that let you draw hero‚Äôs from whatever drawing pools are available at the time. There‚Äôs a lot of flexibility when it comes to in-game currency. So you can, but you don‚Äôt have to spend money in the game to progress. It takes away the feeling of being bound to a game because you spent money on it.
-The puzzles are difficult and actually make you work for your reward. I know that might sound like a con rather than a pro, but most games will just hand you the reward with minimal effort. This game is difficult and that‚Äôs what makes it so fun. It‚Äôs not insanely difficult, especially if you take the time to be prepared for battles and understand the puzzles a bit better than I do, but it will definitely make you sweat.

Cons:
-There are occasionally sharp increases of lag, especially if you play without WiFi (on LTE). It usually doesn‚Äôt affect the game too much, and it‚Äôs only crashed on me once or twice, but the devs update bugs and glitches constantly so it‚Äôs not a big issue.
-The multi-player aspect is a little difficult to grasp. I haven‚Äôt explored it too much yet, but everytime I have either my partner leaves or I leave in the first two minutes.
-The in-game draws are a little unbalanced. Although they‚Äôre free and require in-game items to use, the draws consist of both hero‚Äôs and weapons. Hero‚Äôs have a lower chance of actually being drawn compared to weapons. It‚Äôs a higher chance if you do the 10 at at time rather than the single ones, but still fairly common to not get any hero‚Äôs from a draw at all.
-Food items like meat or fowl are a little difficult to come by unless you grind certain areas to obtain it. Birds and other animals are skittish and will run off of you get too close. You either have to use an archer or use an AOE attack to get meat off of the animals. Later in the game you get to buy the meat and fowl off of merchants, but it‚Äôs still not too much.

Overall, the game is really well made and really fun to play. There isn‚Äôt much hand-holding and it doesn‚Äôt require any in-game purchases (unless you want to try your hand at the draws some more). There are things that can be tweaked, but they‚Äôre very minor and don‚Äôt take away from the concept of the game too much.",5,Better than I expected!,2020-10-27 22:14:45,False

9104,Your dan the fan,"I LOVE the element and status effect system it leads to satisfying combos and visual spectacle. But the combat itself is a bit underwhelming since enemies stagger a lot to your attacks and larger enemies have super predictable movement patterns. It leads to a situation where when I was a level 10 player who could go directly to the purple cube boss and defeat it despite it being level 40. The game just needs to improve its combat system a bit and it would easily be one of the best games ever. Add some counter mechanics like parrying, shields, and weakpoints and decrease enemy stagger significantly. Also for larger enemies make their attack patterns a bit faster because right now they telegraph their attacks so so much that it's beyond predictable what they're going to do. All you do is click the dodge button and bam you're fine.  If I can beat one of the hardest bosses in the game when its at level 40 while I'm at level 10 I think there's something a bit wrong with the game's difficulty scaling and combat systems (more so the latter). I love the open world and element system (given I prefer breath of the wild's non linear level and objective design and puzzles for its open world), but if the combat is too simple it leads to an inability of mastery. The idea of accomplishment in video games doesn't purely stem from beating the game but rather mastering it and its mechanics. Genshin offers the mastery of its elemental system but the challenge it offers sets the bar way too low for its combat system. I like aspects of this game but I really think it has the potential for more and possibly to become one of the best mobile games and video games ever if it significantly improves and capitalizes on its enemy variety and elemental system by improving its combat system through the suggestions above. But rn for me ""personally"" it's okay. (this is just my opinion based on personal levels of reasoning by all means you can like this game, opinions are always valid as long as they don't negatively affect the self or peers mentally or physically.) I'm not asking for like darksouls level of difficulty I just want a good enough of a challenge that slowly progresses with the game that it can challenge the unique element systems that Genshin has with a nice combat system. Genshin‚Äôs graphics and world are stellar and I commend the effort the devs put into this game, but I see the potential this ground work set up for so so much more and I wish it the best. I may be a bit too critical since the game just launched and maybe the devs intend to improve these aspects of the game. However, I felt I had to say something because I just want this game to reach the heights I think it‚Äôs more than capable of given what‚Äôs currently there.",3,"AMAZING ground work, graphics, world, etc, but.....",2020-10-06 02:20:40,False

9180,BdavePlays,"There was quite the hype for this game for a while. I preordered the game a few months ago, but I know people who‚Äôve been waiting for a year or more. I started playing it a few minutes after the official release and have consistently played it since then. I‚Äôve used different platforms and would say that the newer your device, the better the experience. On my iPhone 7, it‚Äôs unplayable to the point it was unenoyable, essentially trash. However, on the IPhone 11, the game runs so smooth with only occasional crashes.

I feel the game is paced very well. For a casual player, you can enjoy the story line, explore the world, and appreciate all it has to offer. There‚Äôs so much to do, a few secret missions, sudden side quests, that the average mobile user would have no issue with game progression. However, I do believe there are a good amount of ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù or dedicated players that progress at such a fast rate that there‚Äôs nothing to do. As of now, I‚Äôm AR33, and have pretty much done all I can with my current line up. I could progress yes, but to level up my AR, I‚Äôd need to purchase resin to fight bosses for that little experience . HOWEVER, this does not mean you can‚Äôt level up; the daily missions supply a good amount of adventure rank and you‚Äôre guaranteed a level up a few times a week if you keep up. I‚Äôve seen a few people level 35+, a few even 40, in my area. As of now, the average seems to be around rank level 30, so I believe in terms of game progression, Genshin Impact is doing a very good job at serving all its player types.

The Gatcha system is so well balanced that it doesn‚Äôt seriously affect your ability to progress in the game. Literally any character can be used to progress, with each one having special abilities that one can specialize in using. I luckily drew a Diluc and the Bell weapon my first pulls, so the game has been extremely easy. Even if you had horrible draws, the game offers you two very powerful characters for free: Noelle and Barabara. I severely underestimated Noelle, and began using her for the Abyss and she has done wonders carrying me team. Along with the few other free characters you‚Äôre given in the story line, you should have no problem fighting the mobs/bosses in the world. 

One issue I do have in the game is the method of leveling up my characters. I feel the game doesn‚Äôt give enough experience for characters if you defeat bosses or mobs. There‚Äôs absolutely no way I‚Äôd be able to max out more characters in order to fight higher level abysses unless I use a few experience books, a rare commodity. I have 3 level 60 characters and 2 level 40/50s and I‚Äôm low on books. I‚Äôve wanted to save some books for my core team, but in order to progress in the abyss I needed a few more stronger characters in my lineup. That said, I feel they need to buff up the amount of experience you get for fighting mobs so that it‚Äôs much easier to level up characters. There‚Äôs so no way I‚Äôd have the time to grind up my characters to max just by fighting mobs. It‚Äôs just unreasonable. That said, people recommend you only hyper focus 1, maybe two characters to level up and play around. This is fine given the amount of books were give (you can probably max out 3, maybe 4 chars at my AR) but I still would like a way to grind up char levels without using books, like buffing the amount of exp you get from mobs. 

Overall, I think the game is very solid, very fun, and easy to get into. I do believe there needs to be some way to advance quicker, but I understand why the developers want to pace the game where it‚Äôs at. There are issues with running the game on iPhone 7, but anything newer than that you‚Äôll have no issues running the game. There are occasional crashes but it‚Äôs not game breaking. The world may seem big at first, but I‚Äôve explored so much of it, and uncovered so many things, that it seems small. I‚Äôm waiting for the next updates for even more story line and fun.

9251,want more Genshin,"This game is amazing. Great gameplay loop, fun and dynamic combat system, enjoyable story and unique characters. There is a gotcha system in this game for both characters and weapons, but you DO NOT need to spend money in this game to complete it. Generally speaking I have no complaints about what is currently in the game.

The huge problem with this game is the lack of content. At first you feel overwhelmed (in a good way) with so much to do and explore. This feeling will stay with you for a few days, possibly weeks if you take it slow. But then you inevitably hit a wall, the story abruptly ends, and you are left with an empty feeling and an empty world. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong there is still plenty to do and plenty to grind... but again, it just feels like meaningless tasks. The world level will increase meaning you can take on existing content at harder levels, but there is no new content. 

Moving forward the plan for the game that the developers have outlined is to update the game every 6ish weeks. Some of these updates seem to be bigger than others. The first update is coming out next week - and while it has new characters and quality of life features... there is very little content added and no continuation of the story.

This game has huge potential, and I am confident it will be amazing and full of content in a years time.... for now - it‚Äôs just too empty and they will just not be able to add enough content to keep their players busy for 6 weeks at a time. 

I still recommend it - but just know the end game is very bland and there is point where you will be longing for more.",5,Not Enough Content,2020-11-06 22:35:54,False

In a short and honest review, Mihoyo put a lot of love, attention and care into these characters and this gorgeous open world, but they also feed off people with gambling addictions. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Mihoyo is just playing it smart, but they need to expand their target audience. A lot of new players that have never played a gacha before will pick this game up, and when they realize they cannot obtain all the characters they want without spending money, they quit the game. Also, a new player could feel like the progression system is too slow compared to a normal open world, which is why they likely picked this game up. Not because it is a gacha, but because it is an open world. Mihoyo shouldn‚Äôt think of this audience as players who won‚Äôt spend money, because that‚Äôs how they treat these players. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt want to spend money on our game, then they don‚Äôt matter‚Äù. This is not completely true. The problem with Genshin isn‚Äôt how bad the drop rates are, or how much currency they give to players, or the prices. The problem is that new players, and eventual returning players CANNOT guarantee every character they want. That makes them not want to play or spend money. Here is an example. If a player wants Venti, Jean or Keqing, and they spend all the free currency they get in game without getting these characters, they don‚Äôt want to buy a chance to get the character. These players will quit the game, because they didn‚Äôt want to spend money. MAKE THEM WANT TO SPEND BY SELLING THEM WHAT THEY WANT. Not everyone playing Genshin is addicted to gachas, A LOT of new players to the gacha genre are playing Genshin because it is an open world. SO START MAKING MONEY OFF ALL YOUR PLAYERS FAIRLY AND HONESTLY BY GIVING US MORE CHARACTER BANNERS MORE OFTEN. Simple, easy. You could even have one copy of each character available to purchase for something stupid like 100$ each and I bet even players new to the gacha genre would consider buying. Don‚Äôt sell new characters for a month or so. This way players still have to spend a lot of money to get duplicates and resources, but we will feel motivated to play and get resources because we are getting what we want to spend our money on. But no, right now we spend money on a random chance to get an off-banner unit without a pity system? I‚Äôm not spending a dollar on this game until a keqing banner shows up, I don‚Äôt care how many gems you mail me. I need to know that I can guarantee what I spend my money on, and no one likes playing a game without the characters they want. Please Mihoyo there are many ways to fix this problem with your players, many different ways you can address the issue.",2,An Open World Gacha NEEDS more CHARACTER BANNERS,2020-12-07 00:00:50,False

9312,DBleeze,"So let me start by saying what the devs have been able to pull off with this game is nothing short of amazing. This is not your average open world mobile title, this is a full fledged AAA open world RPG. This game is also available on PS4 and PC but the mobile version is just as good. Playing on an iPad Pro with graphics setting all the way up this game blows me away. I still cannot believe how beautiful this game is! The art style and game play is incredibly similar to Zelda: BOTW. The only thing it‚Äôs missing is mounts. 

Besides the graphics, the story and gameplay are also top notch. I‚Äôve been playing for about 8 hours and still don‚Äôt feel like I have even scratched the surface. The music is beautiful and the voice acting is very well done and actually adds to the experience, which is rare in mobile titles. The combat system while relatively simple still has enough complexity to make it fun and not feel to hack and slash. It still requires a lot of skill and strategy. 

The only con is that it is not controller compatible despite being able to use a controller on PS4. Luckily the touch controls are well laid out and very polished and don‚Äôt detract from the game at all but I‚Äôd still love to be able to use an Xbox or PS controller for the full console experience. 

The fact that this game is free to play is just wild. Yes there is a gacha monetization strategy but i have completely ignored it to this point and do not feel hindered in any way. It is definitely not pay to win. There are a million other things I can touch on but if you‚Äôre still reading this just stop and download this game already.  Thank you devs for making an incredible game and pushing the envelope for mobile forward. This is the new gold standard for what is possible on a mobile device.",5,"Wow, just wow!",2020-10-09 04:22:02,False

9339,Killercr3amstar,"I don‚Äôt usually play games on my phone. It‚Äôs been years since I have ever actually sat down for more than 20 minutes to play a game on my phone. I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt played many games like Genshin Impact. The ones I have were rather boring or just weren‚Äôt very compatible with a smartphone. 
This is my first review of any app or game, and this game is worthy of it. It surprised me greatly how the developers have created controls and game physics that just seem to work very well on mobile. Sure there are some minor inconveniences occasionally with movement, but generally those can be fixed by simply playing on a tablet or larger screen. Better yet, it would be a fantastic idea for this game to have control compatibility. 
The graphics style are beautiful for a smartphone and revolutionize their platform. 
On to gameplay, this game takes the cake. It has very enjoyable combat systems and loot systems that are very fair. Getting new characters and opening item packs won‚Äôt cost you anything if you simply grind for a while. The prices are fair for packs and the loot itself has very interesting and unique designs. 
Fighting in the game is very fun, though at times it may seem repetitive. I‚Äôve played the game for about 2-3 hours in total if I were to guess, so perhaps combat may become even more difficult as I progress. The unique abilities each character has are fun to use and combine to demolish your enemies. 
The story and characters were the most surprising enjoyment I had. I actually do like the characters. They have some personality to them and break up the pace of the game. I get a good chuckle here and there as I play. The quests have cool stories with endings I don‚Äôt expect and the locations are quite interesting in design.
The map is HUGE and contains many areas where players can get loot and explore. 

Overall, I‚Äôm having a blast with this game and you might too if your in search of BoTW type games. My biggest recommendation for developers is to add controller compatibility. I can anticipate that if that is implemented right, this game might just hit #1 on the charts if it isn‚Äôt there already. I don‚Äôt have a PS4 so playing it on console isn‚Äôt an option.

9367,Z1gu4rt,"Really really nice game, includes a combo mechanic similar to Honkai Impact 3 but has much more freedom due to not being restricted to scenario/arena battles also. The elemental combos are a nice touch, used to solve open world and dungeon puzzles, reminds me a bit of a lite golden sun and definitely of zelda. 

One drawback i see so far is the camera i think it‚Äôs a bit too close, restricts the view on iphone which makes you more reliant on adjusting camera (and the world is gorgeous so it‚Äôs a shame). Zooming out seems to revert to closer angle after a run or if in front of something restricting the view. The joystick also compounds the problem as it‚Äôs a bit too close to the center of the screen (when walking forward my finger is almost at the midway of top/bottom screen). Hopefully a way to reposition the joystick will be introduced. 

The last minor thing is the aiming button (with a ranged character) i think would be much better on the left side of the screen, as camera positioning also positions the aim and currently you have to stop moving camera go into aimed mode and start moving camera again making it a bit less fluid. If on the left side though you would aim with left thumb, already having stopped walking/running to do so, while you aim with the right thumb so you can then fire faster with the left side fire button. These are just minor things im sure can be worked on, either way there‚Äôs a pc version too where the bigger screen would be fantastic!!!

9416,exclarare,"I play this game on PS4 (AR 45), but it‚Äôs so addicting that I find myself downloading it on my phone just so I can start a new file and play when I‚Äôm not at home.

I remember the 75 hours or so I put into Zelda: Breath of the Wild and despite playing it for so long, my reaction to everything I found was generally the same: ‚ÄúEh. S‚Äôokay.‚Äù I remember asking myself how a world can be so open and look so vibrant and somehow be so... underwhelming at the same time. As a longtime Zelda fan, I remember the disappointment very clearly. The trying and trying to force myself to like it because it was Zelda and just not being able to. Other people could and that‚Äôs great, but I felt like I only got half the game that was pitched to me.

Genshin Impact turned out to be the game experience I was looking for in BotW. The sheer amount of things to do. Actually being rewarded with something other than a Korok for exploring thoroughly. The actual STORY that plays out. I don‚Äôt have to look for memories. I get to experience the events of the story AS they‚Äôre happening.

This game was pitched to me as ‚Äúit‚Äôs basically Breath of the Wild, but with actual stuff to do‚Äù, and by golly they were right. At first I almost felt affronted; to say that the visual is a rip-off of BotW is kind of understating it, as well as the premise of the story‚Äôs hero falling into a long slumber during wartime and awakening hundreds of years later. A mostly silent protagonist. Open world puzzles. And again, the landscape and colors are so similar I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt been sued. However while it is visually (and at the start, narratively) similar to BotW, the similarities do end rather quickly. The colors are more vibrant, the characters are more interesting. And the story is nothing like Zelda‚Äôs.

To say nothing of the gameplay. The battle system is fun and intuitive. Harnessing and combining different elements to deal insane damage. FUN exploration. A different play style for every character. Leveling up weapons (that don‚Äôt break!) and artifacts that will further boost your characters‚Äô stats. It‚Äôs all very fun!

There are some drawbacks of course. This is a free-to-play mobile/console game. Certain activities require stamina to claim rewards for (this won‚Äôt really slow you down at first, but it becomes more crucial to be frugal with it the higher your level climbs, and it takes about 5 min to recharge 1 stamina) and beyond the first four characters, every character can only be played after pulling them from the gacha system. The rates aren‚Äôt the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced, but they‚Äôre not fantastic either. I have all but one four star character, and the one five star character I‚Äôve pulled was because I hit the 90 roll pity limit. But this doesn‚Äôt really hold me back as I have a lot of variety to choose from with my normal characters (though I do realize not everyone is as lucky). Sometimes the loading takes a while. And you will notice texture pops. There are drawbacks, but I don‚Äôt feel that they‚Äôre annoying enough to knock a star off my rating.

I could go on forever. I love the game, the lore is accessible and not boring, and the characters can be one-note but are endearing nonetheless. It‚Äôs a more fun and engaging play than Breath of the Wild, and as long as you have self-control it won‚Äôt make you bleed money. Check it out! You have nothing to lose.",5,Breath of the Wild done right,2020-12-07 21:21:07,False

9419,Korukame,"To begin this review I will announce that on the date of November 20, 2020, I am Adventure Rank 43. If you do not know what that means, it means I am fairly deep into the game. The first few hours of this game, let‚Äôs say a day‚Äôs worth, 24hrs total, this game feels amazing, opportunity in every direction, a feeling of freedom. Once you use all up the game‚Äôs starter phase and are well experienced the game gradually starts closing their gates on you the further and further you progress. They do this by using an action limiting currency well known to the community as Resin. Commonly known as ‚ÄúEnergy, Stamina, Lives, Chances, or Uses‚Äù in many other games. Once you hit Adventure Rank 30 you really start to see how limited things are. A beautiful open world game such as this one. A game where you want to feel free and have fun with your friends. Right now, I hate to say it, but this is not that game. At least not until they accept that their system is flawed and make changes. No, not small changes like raising the resin cap. This is what they do about everyone filling them in about their issue. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre listening‚Äù many say, but are they really? If they were actually listening and not trying to swipe every penny from your wallet then they‚Äôd actually make heavy changes that we as the community can be satisfied with. You need resin for just about anything you do in this game. Need character exp? Resin. Need Character Evolution Material? Well guess what, that‚Äôs a separate part of gaining exp. More Resin. Need Weapon Exp? Oh, Resin. Need Mora (In game currency or gold) to upgrade your equipment and characters? Resin. You need to get better equipment for your character? You know what comes next! Resin. You need exclusive material from a once a week boss? Triple the Resin. Yes, once a week. In fact they‚Äôve even added a new system called the reputation system! It sounded great... until it came out. Whilst this does not use Resin, it is also, guess! Action - Limited. Once a week, and you can clear it in less than 30min. So, take this all in. They don‚Äôt give you enough Resin to get enough resources or even to just play the game for enjoyment. They gate you so hard on everything to halt your progress that it is impossible to enjoy the game and it instead just becomes a daily task. Right now, it‚Äôs not looking good. I don‚Äôt want to say this but what it LOOKS like is that this company MiHoYo just wants your money, and does not actually care about what we as the community are saying. This doesn‚Äôt have to be. Fix the resin. I‚Äôd even be happier with rarer drop rates than having to use resin to claim rewards from literally anything meaningful in this game. Boss drops, dungeon loot, Mora, exp. At least it‚Äôd give me a reason to play. A reason to spend time with friends in this game, grinding for some good loot, which right now is actually kind of pointless. Logging on for 10-15 minutes to clear a dungeon and your daily commissions. If I had plans to play with my friends I‚Äôd sure hope it‚Äôs longer than some measly 10-15 minutes. Co-op isn‚Äôt looking too hot either. All of this excludes the early game. The early game is gold and what this game should be by default. Play this game a while and you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about. Have you ever heard of an open world that gates every inch of progression? I have, it‚Äôs called Genshin Impact. Two stars or less until they fix their issue. No one wants to play an open world to play an action-limit game. Two stars for thier... well, I can‚Äôt stress this enough, ACTION LIMITING SYSTEMS and how the game makes me feel as the player. Late game, do I want to play this? Yes, but how it is? No. It‚Äôs more of a daily 10-15 minute hassle/chore than an hour or more of enjoyment. That‚Äôs why I want to play it. To enjoy it freely. Not to play and have the game tell me, oh sorry you can‚Äôt pick that flower anymore, you‚Äôve used up all of your chances. You might have also heard this word as well... Gacha? Ha! I haven‚Äôt even spoken about gacha. Anyways.

9422,Lissykitty101,"Everything in this game is extremely well thought out and incredibly easy to understand. And not in a hand-holding way either. 

 The game encourages you to venture out on your own to forge your own individual adventure. Even with set missions and scripted events no two people will have the same experience. Building your own team isn‚Äôt even the start of it, as just generally walking in a different direction than someone else will give you an entirely different experience. I‚Äôve uncovered many mini bosses and battles simply by practicing my gliding across the mountains or picking ingredients. And the rewards for even the simplest tasks are insanely satisfying. You truly feel like you‚Äôve accomplished something. 

Saying the game is open world is an understatement. The amount of variety in the terrain, landscape, enemies, npcs, dungeons, battles, etc in every zone makes it really seem like real life. The environment is honestly stunning with beautiful nature and water animations and graphics. Graphics that serve a role in how your battles go mind you. The water isn‚Äôt there to just look pretty, as different attacks effect it and surrounding enemies. Want to use an electric attack on the nearby slimes? Jump in the lake and give them a zap. Or how about crossing over a pond? Easy, freeze it an surrounding enemies for an easy way across and a leg up on battle. 

Everything in this game serves a purpose. The townsfolk you see just walking around give you a great idea about different plot points and will even explain and help you through parts of the game. Even if you‚Äôre someone more interested in the gameplay than the story, every piece of dialogue impacts both. It‚Äôs very well written with incredible voice acting that flows perfectly. 

All in all, I highly recommend this game. It will not disappoint.",5,One of the best games on the App Store.,2020-11-11 00:37:57,False

9464,i cant find a nickname ;-;,"It‚Äôs great so far! But there are a few problems, first is that I can‚Äôt see far, because there is a point where the world behind, said point is just a black screen. Which means I can only see the actual world in cutscenes, which are laggy as hell. The you can‚Äôt see enemy‚Äôs in the black void either so I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm fighting.
This also makes the stormterror bossfight impossible.

Now onto the cutscenes... I already said that they are laggy as all hell, so I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt need to repeat that. But there are also certain cutscenes that don‚Äôt lag, but they also have that endless black void I was talking about. So I can‚Äôt see whatever the cutscene is about.

Another problem I have is that you can‚Äôt see water, it‚Äôs the same black void, and when you get wet there‚Äôs this blinding light that shines from you. It‚Äôs the same thing with torches, there‚Äôs bright light that shines from it when you walk near it, and I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm fighting when I‚Äôm near a torch.

But overall those are the only problems I have. The game has amazing potential, but and it‚Äôs kinda like the legend of Zelda breath of the wild, and that‚Äôs an absolute win because that game is amazing, and it inspired a lot of mechanics in a game that I‚Äôm planing to make in the future. I hope that explained why it‚Äôs great that I thought that the game is similar breath of the wild.

9467,TrevorL112,"Wow, I‚Äôm incredibly impressed with this game. To have all of this on a game I can play on my phone is insane! Oh, and the coolest part? When I pick up my game on my PC and I‚Äôm exactly where I was when I left the game on my phone! 
Here‚Äôs some other things I appreciate 
‚Ä¢all of the story dialogue and NPC dialogue is actually spoken, which I love. 
‚Ä¢the colors and art style are super good. At first I thought ‚Äúoh this is kinda like BOTW‚Äù and While it looks like it has some inspiration from BOTW, there‚Äôs a completely original feel to the style. It has more of a Anime style feel to it. There are games like Windbound that take too much inspiration from BOTW and it makes me feel more like I‚Äôm playing a clone than a new game. This game feels refreshing.
‚Ä¢The music! I typically play this before bed so it‚Äôs nice to have calming music with some ambient noise while I roam around. Obviously the combat music is good too, but I appreciate the calming roaming music. 
‚Ä¢It actually feels fluid on my phone. Besides frame rates and some graphical changes, it really doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äòswitching‚Äô to a phone game when I get off my PC. I don‚Äôt feel like the phone version is lesser than my PC version other than the frame rates, really. The graphical stuff is mostly just because it‚Äôs a much smaller screen. 
‚Ä¢The combat is great. I like the idea of having multiple characters to swap between and swap out. As well as upgrading weapons. It gives you so much variation so you can make your team exactly how you want. It reminds me a lot of Pokemon to be honest. 
‚Ä¢ And lastly just the little details like if you go idle, your character performs little animations and stuff. 

The only thing I feel a little annoyed with is there‚Äôs no option to ‚Äòlock‚Äô the player icon north on the mini map, rather than the map being locked on north. Makes it a little hard to navigate, since most of the other games I play have it the opposite way. Of course, I can get used to it. 
Also, I‚Äôm not sure if Mounts or Combat Pets are an option, since I‚Äôve only been playing 2 days but if they aren‚Äôt I think that could be a great edition. Or maybe being able to train wild mounts, like BOTW? But with beasts and creatures instead of horses. That‚Äôll give even more variation in the characters. 

I know I sound like a paid reviewer but honestly I just love video games, and I‚Äôm extremely picky. So when I see those details added in, I really appreciate them. There are some games that could be so much better if they just focused more on the little stuff. This is not one of those games. I‚Äôm on day 2 of playing so far and I love it.

9514,GallantForces,"It is an amazing Surprise and Delight to see what the company MiHoYo is truly capable of producing. With gameplay smooth and sleek, so well thought out that you can play on every character and make your own unique comp for battle and it would always be viable- being a Free to Play player has zero to little disadvantages as there is no true Pay 2 Win features aside from buying more drops, which, don‚Äôt affect your progression in the slightest.

You can really fall in love with the world that the team painstakingly built inch by inch and still not see all that there is, from unique side quests giving you more than satisfying rewards and an interesting story to boot while on the road to your next main story quest. With bosses, dungeons, secrets, treasures and so much to do- it‚Äôs really hard to put the game down.

The only criticism the game truly faces is its pull rates being the lowest of any Gacha game before it, maybe with the slight exclusion being FATE GO. Though the rates are abysmally low, the game itself more than makes up for it and is an absolute MUST download to experience the amazing world and story that it presents.

Despite the main criticism being its Gacha system, the game itself completely and utterly deserves a perfect review score in my opinion as there are hardly any faults I can find with the rest of the game- it‚Äôs story, characters, combat, and the world are all amazingly put together while secrets and side quests keep you going as you explore this vast and amazing world!",5,An Amazing Surprise,2020-11-12 18:43:45,False

9523,Morgan's Wing,"Genshin Impact is a ridiculously well-made game. A few minor bugs, like audio clips playing twice in a conversation kind of things, but as far as game design goes, it‚Äôs solid.

The free to play aspect is fairly mellow as well. While I decided to buy the monthly package, I didn‚Äôt feel like I *had to* in order to get weapons and characters. I mostly did to add suppprt to the company and encourage the creation of these kinds of games more.

There‚Äôs no shortage of things to do. You can wander off in any direction and find hidden chests, cool events, random side quests, or even just collect alchemy and cooking ingredients. There‚Äôs no pressure to do any particular thing.

Combat is easier to get into than most Action RPGs I‚Äôve played. I tend to avoid this genre, which is why it took me so long to check out the game, but this game is definitely user friendly in its combat.

It‚Äôs definitely nailed ‚ÄúOpen World‚Äù. Despite there being Invisible Walls, I never felt like I was being restricted on where I could explore.

The gliding mechanic hasn‚Äôt gotten old yet, and I can‚Äôt see it happening anytime soon. I honestly glide anytime I possibly can, even if it just down some stairs.

The art is fantastic, animation fits the aesthetic of the world, and the voice acting is solid.

I don‚Äôt recommend free to play games to a broad audience very much; they‚Äôre typically too genre-focused to appeal to a lot of people. This one is an exception. If you have a device that can run it, it‚Äôs worth checking out for sure.

9553,AsheDalmasca,"It‚Äôs hard to believe this game is free-to-play, considering how beautifully done everything is. The graphics, the user interface, the gameplay, the story, the music and the voices are top notch. It has many similar elements and gameplay to Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but takes those mechanics and adapts them very well for mobile devices. I am not sure how it would do on a phone as I am playing on an iPad Mini‚ÄîI‚Äôd recommend you use a device with a large enough screen (or just play on PC or console) because you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice playing on a small screen.

I have played through and completed Prologue II. I have to raise my Adventurer rank to continue the story, but it‚Äôs a good ‚Äúresting‚Äù point as it forces the player to really explore the world and game. The devs really managed to pack so much content and thoughtful details into the game. This is an open world exploration game and wow, there really is tons to explore. You can even set the voice language to English, Japanese, Chinese, or Korean!

Unlike many other MMO games, the user interface is super clean and not overwhelming or intimidating for new or casual players. I really appreciate this and how the game logically and gradually helps you learn how to play. You are never rushed into completing objectives and can really go at your own pace.

The drop rates are a bit stingy, as most apps with random chance are. There are a some characters but there are also a bunch of weapons in the mix. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it, but I appreciate that they do give you a basic set of characters that you should be able to work with for a good portion of progress. I feel like if I put in the effort to level and use them I may not need to try to summon characters... BUT because this game is so well done I truly think if you‚Äôre the type to invest in games this would be a great investment.

*Possible game spoilers*
This is just my personal approach to the game. And bias in that I play with my best friend. So it‚Äôs all 100x enjoyable.

The story and music is wonderful. The aesthetic of the characters and scenery is breathtaking.

Every character have their own perks, story you can read about, lines they speak. Down to their animation on how they put away their weapons.

I will admit that I‚Äôm one of those people who like to explore before doing my main quests. To which I regret (But I‚Äôll do it again. Responsibly) because I just screw myself over in increasing my world level and then everything just hurts. It‚Äôs just my poor strategy and giggles. And not using my resin because I didn‚Äôt immediately need materials. Game pretty much punished me for going to China while Germany was in peril. (Deserved it)

As for the gacha statistics. As someone who play for the characters, their drop rates is great. As least 1 character is guaranteed per bulk pull (a playable character is always 4* or 5*. 3* and under are weapons) and considering there‚Äôs only about 20 characters released, it‚Äôs great. There‚Äôs also featured characters. Where there‚Äôs a higher drop of that character. They have pity drops where every 90 pulls will guarantee you a 5* character or weapon with an additional 50% chance of actual getting that 5* as the featured character. (I assume if you didn‚Äôt happen to pull a 5* before hand). There‚Äôs a lot of hate every banner btw. For my current example ‚ÄúZhongli‚Äù I‚Äôm hearing a lot of people  saying to buff him, but I like him as is. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised people will say to nerf him later like all 5* characters. He‚Äôs my main casual DPS. Great support and defense. I chuck that pillar down and it starts chipping damage away at my enemies. It distracts big shields making them turn to the pillar instead of paying attention to me. I then put up my shield for myself as it does an AOE flinching my enemies. I make sure to bunch my enemies together and slam down that meteor and petrify them. Friend is in trouble? Big shield is chasing them? I use the fast normal attack to keep big shield‚Äôs attention on me while they attack from behind. Friend is being ganged up by a mob? I chuck that meteor down right on them. Ez mass petrification.

There‚Äôs also equipping your characters with appropriate accessories and weapons where you can optimize their skills and attacks. This game is strategic. Can‚Äôt just toss something together and expect it to work for higher world levels. Monsters can one shot you if not mindful.

9564,PiMan3.14159265358979323846264,"Firstly, for those who are severely criticising this game: WELCOME TO GACHA!!!; or if you‚Äôre having issues playing the game: Keep in mind the game is still very new to the public, and much more is to be added, reorganised, or removed. Also, no game is perfect. Look at your favourite or the most popular video games, for example. They all have bugs and glitches somewhere.
Since the game is so new and miHoYo isn‚Äôt extremely big, their support staff is pretty low for all the people who need to contact them since the release.
To those using mobile devices, I strongly recommend using a computer instead if available. If the game keeps crashing on PC, check the recommended/minimum requirements to run the game.

Now to my review:
I was playing a game and saw the ad for Genshin Impact. It instantly grabbed my attention because it is an open world, action roleplaying game. It has amazing graphics, despite looking cartoonish. The music is extremely beautiful, very well-made and fits the mood perfectly (except that one situation...üòâ  üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏èüå±). The movements are smooth as butter. The story is most interesting (in my opinion, it rivals that of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim). There are many challenges (achievements, dungeons/boss battles, timed trials, stuff to search for). There are many characters to obtain, each are very distinguishable. The foods and drinks look delicious; I really wish I could try them all ü§§ü§§ü§§. I love everything in this game! As you progress, the game gets more challenging, but if you play it long enough, it gets a lot easier.

We really do have the best travel companionüíô

I do not recommend this game for those who are under the recommended age group (12+).
I highly recommend this game for anyone who qualifies for the recommended age group and loves open world action roleplaying games.

Last thing:
Like I said before, the game is very much a work in progress. If you‚Äôre impatient, do some research how long it takes to create just one of the sceneries. Then, imagine the whole map + your menu + upcoming events.
And then, people demand more once they finish the main story yet not finish everything in each region.

9566,BirdyMargo,"This is not a mobile game. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it play like one. It‚Äôs particularly demanding storage-wise. All of that in mind, this game is amazing.

It combines elements like a tower-map system, glider, huge open world, and climbing mechanics similar to Zelda: BOTW, but with completely unique combat and story line. This game actually captures the anime-style action a lot of people crave, including simplistic yet expressive graphics.

The small party the player controls, usually consisting of 4-5 characters, resembles the parties we‚Äôre used to seeing in traditional RPG games. Where this deviates from the formula, however, is that only one of your characters is active at a time. In this way, it‚Äôs similar to a hack-slash featuring different classes. With this system, you can switch instantly between them, combining skills individual characters into larger more powerful combinations. This makes combat largely skill and strategy based. Timing does play a part, but isn‚Äôt the main factor like it is in Zelda: BOTW. 

Some other random cool things:
- your weaponry and items never break.
- items and characters are largely acquired through random crates.
- this game is massive, way bigger content-wise than any other mobile game I‚Äôve seen.
- the game is playable and fun without spending real currency.

Less cool things:
- you will probably run out of special currency early on and regaining it will be difficult without spending money.
- the game is designed to be profitable so paying real money gives you a lot more opportunities (not unexpected though, since it‚Äôs a free game!).
- items are obtained at random most of the time, which means you can have a streak of bad luck that wrecks your day.
- the phone storage for this game is huge, which is not surprising considering how massive the game is.

There‚Äôs probably a lot more to add to both of these lists, but I‚Äôm early on in the game so my perspective is a bit limited.

9580,Nixy,"Genshin Impact is surprisingly good! I always have low expectations for mobile games with Gacha elements but so far I‚Äôve been quite impressed. Not only does it have beautiful art, but it also has an interesting story and entertaining characters. It‚Äôs not aggressively monetized so far (which actually makes me more likely to want to buy things from it, since I feel like I don‚Äôt need to dump tons of money in just to get basic functionality) and there is a surprising amount to explore in the open world. I‚Äôm quite pleased thus far. 

The game takes obvious inspiration from Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but still feels like it‚Äôs own game and world thanks to the addition of elemental combat magic and Final Fantasy-esque monsters. The JRPG w/ gacha elements reminds me of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 as well. The combat has a decent amount of depth, thanks to all all the elemental reactions and different character classes/weapons. I really like all the puzzles and exploration rewards. It‚Äôs almost a bit overwhelming, as someone who searches obsessively for items lol. There are some frustrating moments (like when I was knocked off a cliff by a group of enemies and couldn‚Äôt get back up to fight them, since their magic attacks kept interrupting my climbing and making me fall) but for the most part combat is pretty fun and gets surprisingly challenging. I‚Äôm still getting the hang of it and finding my preferred playstyle but I‚Äôm having a good time. 

It‚Äôs a little bit uncomfortable to play on my smaller phone (iPhone 11) even though I have small hands, but there are wireless controllers that can be used with iPhones that would probably make it easier/more comfortable to play. I may end up downloading it on a console, if it will let me transfer my account. 

Overall, it‚Äôs a surprisingly good game. It‚Äôs kid friendly as well so far, so you could safely play it with children. The character design is delightful and not overly sexualized, which is a big plus. Is it the best game ever made? No. But for a free to play mobile RPG, I‚Äôm very happy with it.",5,One of the best mobile RPGs I‚Äôve played,2020-10-05 18:03:33,False

9603,maxxusbaxxus,"Intro: 

This game is a beautiful BEAUTIFUL well made game, with outstanding graphics considering it can even be played on mobile devices and amazing plot and voice actors with a variety of characters! You‚Äôve really outdone yourself Mihoyo, and I applaud you for it!! This game is my most favorite to play. 

Gacha: 
But...let‚Äôs talk about the Gacha system, this is the ONLY problem I have with this game. 
The problem is, there is not separate weapon and character banners. I understand most Gacha works like this, but I‚Äôve played MANY that don‚Äôt as well; at the least, please make he drop rate of weapons lower, please. I spend 40$ on this game today and only got one character I didn‚Äôt have who was a 4 star, not to mention it only gave me 20 something pulls and that was with the added bonus, but I‚Äôll get to that in a minute. The drop rate of weapons is horrid, and needs to be toned down or just put into one banner like the one that only drops weapons instead of bleeding into the character banners too. 

On another note, the prices for the amount of things you get is bad too; I understand since this game is completely free you need to make money and that‚Äôs 100% cool with me!! I‚Äôm so down to pay money for stuff in it........ but it‚Äôs very very very low. I think that for 20$ you should at least get 3-4 10x pulls instead of 2 and a half. 

(Or, an alternative would be paying for primogems or fates themselves as another option instead of being forced to only pay for the blue gems which cost a lot just to make primogems which cost a lot to make 1 fate.) I also think the 5$ daily login dropping only 90 primogems a day is kinda low too, maybe 100 a day or enough for just 1 wish? (160) 

Another problem is also doubles: they need to be much lowered if you have a character already, or just give the materials to make another wish when you get the double‚Äî or remove doubles completely‚Äî! There‚Äôs many other options..it just gets annoying when you get a double of a character you have and then get barely anything you can use out of it except for a constellation which isn‚Äôt that important. 

Oh! One more thing: another fix to this all would be to lower the prices of primogems you pay for the fates, or to lower the price of getting primogems in general! Such as just making them more common or have more in missions, Ect. 

Outro: 
That‚Äôs honestly all I had to say!! Thank you so so so so much for creating this game, it brings me a lot of happiness and I seriously love it so much! I just feel like I had to bring out some of the Gacha flaws into the open. <3",4,AMAZING GAME! ...but gacha functions horribly.,2020-11-14 00:38:44,False

9615,TheDynamicOne,"Genshin Impact is a beautiful open world action rpg with great music and pretty cool combat system with the elemental combos and I absolutely love it for what it does right. So you‚Äôre probably wondering why did I give it one star. Well this game has a HUGE issue currently as of writing this. The resin system. It‚Äôs currently one of the worst energy systems I‚Äôve ever seen from any mobile game and when you take into consideration how much you have to farm mats, exp books, mora, taken books and weapon ascension materials for a SINGLE character. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. The game is great from the moment you start all the way till around AR 30. Until then you probably won‚Äôt notice the resin system because you‚Äôre doing main/side quests and exploring. After you‚Äôve done all that the only thing left to do is farm the things you need for the characters you have because it‚Äôs the only meaningful content for progress. Except you can‚Äôt really do much because those activities cost anywhere from 20-60 resin but you only have 120 each day and it takes 16 hours for a full regeneration. There is no way around this except by spending currency that you would use for character rolls or by outright paying money for diminishing returns for each 60 resin refill (doesn‚Äôt even fully refill). By the time you reach AR 30 you have about 15-20 minutes of content from your dailies to resin usage and then you‚Äôre done. There was a post on the reddit page of this game explaining, mathematically, how badly this system is gating progress for players and how it basically it can take 42 days to level up a character to max and that‚Äôs not even considering the weapons or artifacts you need for them to actually do damage. There is a war of ideas between people who want changes and white knights defending an inherently bad system just because they don‚Äôt want people playing longer than them and getting more from more playtime and because it exists on the mobile market but forget that it also made it into the PC/PlayStation market and most of those players, including myself are very disgusted with the current system. Until changes are made this system is overshadowing all of the good in the game because you can only do 20 minutes of actual progressing content for yourself and what‚Äôs that‚Äôs done all you can is explore and try to find chests where you haven‚Äôt already looked on the map. The game at that point is extremely boring since you can‚Äôt do the content you actually want to do. If you aren‚Äôt at AR 30 I urge you not to spend money on this game until you experience what I‚Äôm talking about because it will change your perspective of this game. This game has such huge potential but it‚Äôs ruined by an unnecessary gating system that serves no purpose other than to limit your progress, try to make you play over a longer period of time but in little bursts, and to extract even more money from their player base in a very underhanded way, even though most of their revenue comes from banners and rolls. I regret spending money on this game because it‚Äôs very likely that it will lose a lot of players by next mont, including myself, if changes aren‚Äôt made soon.",1,Resin system will be the death of this game,2020-10-14 23:02:02,False

I love the art style of this game and it‚Äôs technically just an anime version of Breath of the Wild! All the characters have amazing personalities, and unlike botw, you can actually play as more than one character and you can choose the protagonists gender.

 I feel like I sound weird but honestly, I think the is one of the best games I have on my phone and doubt I‚Äôll ever delete it! I always get excited when there‚Äôs a new event or new Wish banner! I‚Äôm not too far in the game (I‚Äôm only at chapter 2 act 1 while I‚Äôm writing this but I may go to act 2 pretty soon) but I definitely think that if your CRAVING a game like this, this is a pretty good game! I‚Äôll say Honkai Impact is a pretty good game too but I haven‚Äôt played that yet! and I‚Äôm also waiting very HARDCORE for the Ballad in Goblets (or however that was written it‚Äôs been a bit) to come back, cause I BADLY want Venti even though my chances are most likely lower than 20%. MiHoYo, if you guys are reading this, I just wanna say how much I appreciate how much hard work you guys put in to this game! 

On the map screen Teyvat looks small but when exploring it‚Äôs SO BIG! probably the biggest map I‚Äôve ever seen! So if anybody who wants to buy the game is reading this, I‚Äôm happy I introduced you a bit to this absolutely awesome game! I should also mention that the voice actors are super good and just make the game a lot more lively than if there wasn‚Äôt! It‚Äôs a great game and I highly suggest getting is!

9642,bigdawgshitt,"Genshin Impact. A phenomenal game that went beyond my expectations. I‚Äôve been playing for just two days but every moment has got me absorbed in the game. To start with my experience, I was skeptical at first because it sounded like another regular fantasy game and it seemed overhyped the past few months. I decided to install it a week ago because I thought there has to be a reason why there‚Äôs so much craze for it. Little did I know, Genshin Impact would be and is the FIRST mobile game that has made me excited to play it and impressed me for being such a well developed game story-wise, gameplay-wise, and graphic-wise, beyond my expectations.

The character design and the graphics are what caught my attention at first. But, I will say that the first hour playing was definitely a lot to take in, with all the buttons, options, character info and abilities, inventory, and quests, but as I continued playing I got used to it and it has been A BLAST afterwards.

I love this game, however a major issue is that I get motion sickness, dizziness, and nausea playing this game. Although I beared it the first hour yesterday, and the last 4 hours today, I realized that I can‚Äôt play this game for more than 15-30 minutes without getting nauseous and feeling dizzy, causing me to take a break from my entire iPad for a long time. I as well as many other players who experienced the same thing even on console and PC, can‚Äôt enjoy this game to its full potential because of this reason and I believe it has to do with the FOV(field of view) being too small or very close up, the motion blur in the background, the camera automatically adjusting itself and moving on its own whenever the character moves/runs, the resolution, the sensitivity being a bit too high even on lowest setting (1), etc, and there is currently nothing we can do about it.

I‚Äôve been playing mobile games for two years specifically first person shooting games like CODM, Critical Ops, and PUBGM. I find that even when first playing it, I didn‚Äôt experience dizziness or sickness, something I usually experience in other games like open world or third person games, like Minecraft. The reason for that is because the FOV in these shooting games are larger, I assume.

Another issue is the major battery consumption. I do play on an iPad that works well with its battery life and does not drain. But, I was playing today with full battery and it depleted to 10% within 4 hours. It‚Äôs alarming that this application consumed 84% of my device‚Äôs battery, without the usage of other apps. Please fix this issue with battery.

It‚Äôs very unfortunate that many Genshin players have experienced motion sickness to the point where it is unbearable to play, and there is no way of changing the settings to cope with this. I wish that the FOV and resolution is bigger and the camera does not automatically moving around, etc. and the aspect of the motion, graphics, fov and resolution are fixed ASAP, and we have the options in the settings to change these things. 

I also hope we can move our control buttons around the screen (hud) since some of us do play with four or more fingers. The issue is with the settings‚Äîmaybe y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt yet developed them or didn‚Äôt plan to, but I do highly suggest there are more options in the settings, all coming from a player‚Äôs perspective of the game. Nonetheless, Genshin Impact has definitely proved itself for being an amazing game of quality, creativeness, graphics, gameplay, movement, abundance of characters, interesting storylines, a unique aesthetic, and I see all of your hard work put into this game.

To the developers and team of Genshin Impact, I do hope this lengthy but honest review is taken into consideration and these issues are looked over and resolved in the near future so I and many other players can enjoy and experience this game to the fullest. There will only continue to be much work and needed improvements in the future, so I do want to see these fixes as I believe they are of importance and would make the game much, much better than it already is.

9646,IgNiToRkId,"I do find this game to be very fun. I‚Äôm a huge fan of gacha games (for those who don‚Äôt know, those are games where you spend in-game currency to do pulls on special events to try and get stuff like playable characters and weapons, all at different rarities), they have a fair system where if you get character copies you can use them to give that character special buffs, the game looks amazing for a mobile, and the controls are fairly comfortable. While you can pay money for in game currency to do more pulls or refill energy for certain quests or special bosses, the game is very free-to-play friendly, despite what others might say. You can easily beat the game and fully enjoy it with just the starter characters as long as your half way decent with the combat. The game also has a pity system that‚Äôs, at the very least, better than most with every 90 pulls being a guaranteed 5-star character/item and, depending on the special banner you summoned from, the first 5-star you get has a 50% chance to be the featured item and the next one will be guaranteed. I haven‚Äôt paid any money on the game, gotten 2 5-stars, and haven‚Äôt even done 90 pulls yet (but that‚Äôs my personal experience considering that they have a 0.6% drop rate).

But of course, being the mobile version, it will be a little clunky compared to the console and pc versions. *WARNING* This game will practically incinerate your phone. Your phone will become hot to the touch after a couple of minutes depending on your graphics settings. The game does also have some frame rate and crashing, these can also be fixed by lowering the graphics settings (very low, low, normal, high, very high). On the bright side though, this game has, BY FAR, the best auto save mechanic I‚Äôve ever seen in a game. This game will save your exact location and status of your characters, account, progress, etc. no matter what.
The main reason I didn‚Äôt give this game a 5-star rating instead of a 4-star one was because once you beat the game, there‚Äôs not really much to do except explore or do whatever additional story quests or events that hat added on periodically.

And now to address some other complaints I‚Äôve noticed in these ratings:

‚ÄúYou need to give email/password from google or Facebook or gaming center, etc.‚Äù
-While true... get over yourself, no one cares.

‚ÄúGame won‚Äôt start‚Äù
-I haven‚Äôt experienced this or heard anyone else complain about it

‚ÄúGame erasing progress‚Äù
-Again, like the last one, I personally haven‚Äôt experienced this nor heard this from anyone else in the community.

‚ÄúGame doesn‚Äôt provide controller support‚Äù
-True. But you people realize there are like 20 games on the entire App Store that have controller support, right?",4,Overall an amazing game,2020-11-19 06:18:47,False

9662,akire18,"I absolutely love this game overall! It offers a beautiful open-world with varied combat styles, quests, and treasures to be uncovered. It‚Äôs obvious they put a lot of effort into this game and it‚Äôs awesome that it‚Äôs free. But for as much as I love the game, here are some of my main issues (summary at the end): 

One, the leveling up system is a little too hard as you go on. The easiest way to do it is using cards, but you don‚Äôt get too many of the higher level ones so it makes it a lot tougher to gain levels. This wouldn‚Äôt be such a problem if not for the game encouraging that you switch your character pretty often. You can concentrate on leveling up just one character if you want, but then you‚Äôll likely be switching to other lower-level characters when the time comes.

This leads me into two: you can only play as one person at a time despite having a party. It would be really cool to have the other characters in your party fight alongside you, and then you could just switch between your main. It would be extremely useful when fighting multiple enemies. This wouldn‚Äôt bother me as much if the elemental system, and therefore switching, wasn‚Äôt as emphasized.

Three, the game gives you information on enemies, combat, etc. you come across as the game goes on, but as far as I can tell there‚Äôs no way to actually refer back to it. I‚Äôm not sure if this is something that maybe gets unlocked later on, but it would be especially useful to have as a beginner or returning player. 

Four, the co-op system should probably be available earlier. A lot of people would probably want to play this game just for that function, but it isn‚Äôt unlocked until you‚Äôve leveled up your adventure rank I think to level 15.

TLDR; leveling up is difficult, you can only switch between characters instead of having them all deployed at once, you don‚Äôt seem to be able to refer back to information you get throughout the game, and co-op should be offered sooner.",4,Love it!!! But...,2020-10-04 17:01:11,False

9722,Otomachi_Unagi,"4/5 stars is probably more than I should be giving this game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous and fun. I play on both PC and mobile for a couple hours before bed each night. The story is engaging and the characters are quite entertaining (well, as entertaining as they can get with English voice acting).

My issue is the gacha. I understand that the developers need to make money... but this game could have been better if it was a different form of payment. I would have been fine having to pay for a sub or a one time fee of $30+ for a BOTW-like experience on my phone/PC.

Sadly the mobile market relies on whales to run. Everyone knows that. Rich people or people with poor money management issues will spend thousands on games like these... they foot the bill for average players. But again... I would prefer it be a ‚Äúplay a trial for free‚Äù and you can pay a one time payment of X amount to be able to just play to get the characters, and play to get the gear, and maybe have SOME wait times but are never too intrusive to the gameplay (something like Bravely Default, where it only serves to help you more and is never really necessary just to beat the base story).

I‚Äôm sure the game won‚Äôt get better in terms of drop rates. It‚Äôs really fun in its honeymoon phase but unless you‚Äôre willing to reach that point of only logging on to do dailies after a bit (or spending money), I don‚Äôt recommend playing more than what you‚Äôre willing to.

I‚Äôm not even saying this game is bad, it‚Äôs sincerely not. The graphics are good (play on an iPhone 8 and up, it will not run well on older devices and in many cases won‚Äôt even open for those using a 7+ or less in terms of iPhone), the gameplay is fun for it being a hack and slash, and the grind isn‚Äôt too awful at first... just don‚Äôt expect the game to be fun forever. A wall will be hit at some point as they press for more money over time.",4,It‚Äôs Complicated.,2020-10-09 11:05:23,False

9738,aShnovdegc,"Genshin Impact starts off really great. There is a lot of stuff to do in the world and the map is huge. This game looks good, has a great open world, great characters etc. I really like playing this game but as for how long probably not long. Once you reach around Adventure Rank 30 the game drastically starts to slow down as you have completed a majority of the main story quests, explored a majority of the map and start nitpicking for experience from world quests, chests to bump you up to the next rank or spending resin on domains/bosses. Their resin system is probably the biggest flaw as of right now. It is seriously time gated to where an average gamer can get on do the daily commissions, burn their resin, go to work, come home and still not have the max limit of resin. When it comes to rolling for characters this is probably the worst of the worst when it comes to the rates. The ‚Äúpity system‚Äù is great for 4-star characters but absolutely garbage for 5-star characters. If you pay $$$ to roll characters you are looking at $200 just to get a 5-star character from 90 rolls which is their pity system if you are not lucky. That is just for one character. Which each character has a constellation that is upgradable from duplicate characters. As for the characters it requires A LOT to fully max out one character to the point where it is best to only focus upgrading 2-3 characters at one time because they will use up everything you have and then some. Upon release as well when players were getting all this free stuff and thinking this is awesome. Codes were released for people to claim primo gems (what you use to roll for characters or resin refills if you are an f2p player). These codes were unable to be used by console players on PS4. They were only redeemable by PC and Mobile. Since then there have been some events here and there mainly around logging in and claiming rewards which are nice but considering how far those rewards actually go when it comes to doing anything in the game is really lacking. There also was a co op event where you collect cubes and fight waves of enemies. This event was more of a grind it out and never touch it again than an enjoyable event with replay value. Also, it was horribly optimized to where players would glitch out either running in place or unable to pickup/deposit the cubes. This is a really great game and can be really fun early game but late game it is more resource management making it hard for Streamers/YouTubers to do their JOB for long periods of time. Really great game but lackluster events, disappointing rewards and even worse management.",1,Slowly being killed by it‚Äôs own hands,2020-10-30 20:16:53,False

9757,Collin_56,"The game overall is very fun to play and I make sure to play daily.

I feel the game isn‚Äôt very considerate of the free to play players. Primogems become very scarce so it gets much harder to do any wishes. I believe Mihoyo needs to start catering to the f2p players soon as well, because they are more valuable than the p2p at the end of the day.

1.1 Update:

    I was also excited for the quality of life features in the 1.1 update but locking all of those items behind the Reputation System was a bad choice. It‚Äôs going to take months to grind up enough reputation in each area to get the rewards, and by the time you do get the rewards you won‚Äôt need them anymore. (You can also just look up the Genshin Interactive Map to find all the chests and anemoculus/geoculus anyways, so the rewards are essentially useless) 
    There should be weekly missions and bounties for BOTH Liyue and Teyvat so that you can build reputation in both places at once, instead of choosing only one to grind at a time.

Customer Service:

Overall customer service responses are very slow.
Also, I encountered a bug in the game and customer service didn‚Äôt help me, and the session was left to expire, meaning I have to contact them again (ugh).
I completed a commission but didn‚Äôt unlock the achievement for it, and instead of helping me they talked about the Welkin Blessing. (I hope they weren‚Äôt dodging my issue on purpose, because it seems like they were)

We‚Äôre really lucky this game is free, and there are so many great things about it and I really enjoy playing the game but some aspects of it are starting to wear me out. Hopefully there will be more consideration for players customer service wise and game wise.",4,"Slow Customer Service, Needs More Primogems, Great Overall",2020-11-17 19:22:25,False

9817,Obo The Rust,"It took me 2 minutes of playing this game to realize it‚Äôs an exact copy of legend of Zelda, breath of the wild. The game starts with some exposition that I don‚Äôt remember, and you get to pick a character. You spawn on a beach with an incredibly annoying rat fairy that won‚Äôt stop talking. As I‚Äôm walking up the beach, I see a lizard that looks almost identical to the lizards you‚Äôd find in BOTW. Just like in BOTW, you can pick up the lizards and basically anything else you find. I was like, ‚Äúhuh, ok, maybe it‚Äôs just inspiration‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Then from what I can remember, you learn how to run. When you run you use up stamina, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the stamina wheel is an exact copy and paste from BOTW. You can also do all the other things you can do in BOTW, like climb and jump a very small distance. You then walk up to a hill, and at this point, I know what‚Äôs going on. Almost the exact same layout for the landscape was used. To get down the hill you have to walk down a path going down the side of the mountain, just like BOTW. There is a large castle in the background, just like BOTW. Even the opening shot of the camera panning across the landscape, is exactly. Like. BOTW. There‚Äôs also a large tower in the middle of the map, that allows you to see a mini map. Wonder where that‚Äôs from? If you hadn‚Äôt already guessed, it‚Äôs BOTW. There was also some kind of element thing that was boring so I didn‚Äôt pay attention to it, but I guess that‚Äôs at least something different. As I walk away from the tower, I see some monsters that have the exact same spiky thingys coming out of the ground that BOTW has, and the monsters have the exact same weapons as the bokoblins from BOTW. At this point, I had decided that I‚Äôm not going to waste my time playing a game I‚Äôve already played. In conclusion, this game is a complete rip off of legend of Zelda breath of the wild. I‚Äôm honestly surprised Nintendo hasn‚Äôt sued this company for this yet. Also, I looked through the reviews, and nobody seems to be noticing this. The only possible reason for this I can think of is that the devs are deleting reviews that bring up this point.",1,Scummiest devs on the planet,2020-11-09 13:08:34,False

9848,djakfhdixjehr,"I love this game; it truly scratches all the itches as a player: gacha dopamine spikes, lots of different aspects of a character to level, and above all, a writing and design team that is obviously truly passionate about their game, characters and world. 

But, there does seem to be a fatal wrench shoved in the gears of the game; the team behind updates and changes to the system that the player base has been absolutely screaming about for a full month since the games release. I won‚Äôt get into them here, I don‚Äôt have nearly enough space, but to summarize; the team seems adamant to make sure that outside of story updates, you have about 15 minutes of enjoyable content twice a day if you‚Äôre lucky. Commissions > two world bosses>one or two dungeons and poof, you‚Äôll be wandering around begging for something interesting to do. To be clear; I have spent money on this game, and I do not regret it; but, with the devs most recent response to the thousands of player surveys is anything to judge by, it‚Äôs currently unlikely I‚Äôll be making any other purchases. If these factors change, I‚Äôd love to change my rating to five times it‚Äôs current amount.
To summarize: I‚Äôm fine with the terrible gacha rates. I‚Äôm fine with the horribly expensive gems. I‚Äôm fine with long update cycles, and I‚Äôm fine with the low drop rate on high rarity materials, as well as the incredible material and fiscal cost of leveling anything in Teyvat.

9867,Wpxz,"The game it self it ‚Äúfine‚Äù well there is sooooooo much issue with. One of the biggest issue now is the level progression and rewards failure. U won‚Äôt feel it until u hit around lv 45. Because then u don‚Äôt really have anything to do to increase ur level. Furthermore no one want to admit it but once u hit certain lv your world lv increase. World lv 6 and lv 7 doesn‚Äôt have any significant reward change whatsoever ever. There is a thing called risk and reward, and who‚Äôs failed in every aspect of it. World 7 has more loved enemies than lv6 but the reward stay the same, and players need to get to world lv 8 to do so tht is equal to lv 55. Now if u don‚Äôt know the difficulty to actually get tht lv ask anyone around u who play Genshin how hard is to get a lv after lv45
Second issue is the stamina system. Let just say if u r a free to play player, u will not be able to get much resource to train a lot of new characters. The game offers you different characters and new ones came out like every 2 week. If u are at late game u just can‚Äôt effectively get a new character and rapidly getting tht character to the lv of your domains. 
Last is we‚Äôre I have the most issue with, is the arrogance of the puplisher and developer Mihoyo itself. Just remember this if there is any bug tht benefit to players like the ‚Äúmushroom bug‚Äù, ‚ÄúXingqu and Barbara‚Äôs stamina bug‚Äù they will fix it in a day. Now if it‚Äôs a bug tht won‚Äôt benefits to players like the ‚Äúice tree terrain hole‚Äù ‚Äúwind dragon‚Äôs neck‚Äù they won‚Äôt fix it until next version update. And on top of that I asked for a receipt they literally disconnected me from their customer service.

9874,SinjonC,"Assuming the anime-ness of the world isn‚Äôt a turnoff for you, there lies a very competent game inside. If you‚Äôve played BotW before, then it‚Äôs easy to see why most people call this game an anime Breath of the Wild, though it isn‚Äôt just a clone.
For one, the combat in this game is closer to NieR: Automata than Zelda, with the ability to switch between party members during combat. This game also has a progression system similar to JRPGs like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, where doing quests and finding new items and locations in the world rewards you with EXP.
The gacha elements might be a controversial element for some, but as far as I can see it‚Äôs not necessary to use it to progress through the story.
Another thing about this game on iOS is how well this game runs. Granted, i‚Äôm playing this game on the latest 2020 iPad Pro but even then i‚Äôm able to play this game with its graphics settings cranked up to their max and am still able to get a consistent 60fps, and it certainly is one of the best looking mobile games i‚Äôve seen on the app store.
My biggest gripe with the game by far however, is the lack of gamepad support. It‚Äôs disappointing to see a major game such as this launch without any support for an external controller, especially as this game is also available on PC and PS4. Touch controls are fine and it would be a bit weird to use a controller on a smaller device, but having no support for it nearly a month after it‚Äôs official launch is bizarre.
Also of note is the small ‚Äòquirks‚Äô this game sometimes has. Whether it be small gaffs in scripting or odd dialogue it‚Äôs certainly noticeable but it‚Äôs not gamebreaking, at least none that i‚Äôve encountered.
Overall though this is still a very good game, and especially for a free game it‚Äôs certainly worth the try.",4,"Good, Fun Game",2020-10-25 02:18:24,False

9876,CupcakeTrue,"As someone who‚Äôs still only in the very beginning of the game, I‚Äôll share my impression so far by saying that Genshin is a game with a lot to offer; amazing visuals, fantastic voice acting, a fun storyline, a colorful setting, ample customization, straightforward but challenging combat, and overall gameplay that puts other IOS apps to shame. As far as I can tell, it‚Äôs forgiving to newcomers, but still fun for more avid gamers, or anyone looking for an engaging pastime.

That said, the experience of playing Genshin is seriously hampered by a few major bug on IOS. The first (relatively more minor) one is related to the cutscenes. Now, what I‚Äôm able to see of them, the cutscenes look great, but more often it‚Äôs irritating experience rife with buffering, interruptions, skipped portions, and on a few occasions the scenes outright crash the app. Just to get through the scenes, I have to strategically leave the game and then return after 30 seconds. 

Very annoying, but tolerable if it wasn‚Äôt in addition to a bigger problem, namely an odd ‚Äúvoid effect‚Äù on the sky and moderately distant surroundings. Practically anything not directly in front of the avatar is compelling obscured by pitch black shadows, including certain integral scenes, water features, and enemies, including the Storm dragon. As a matter of fact, I‚Äôm at the boss fight now and it‚Äôs honestly impossible to surpass because the entire screen is shrouded in darkness. Obviously, something is off, and after some research I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm not the only one having this issue. 

Finally, there‚Äôs another bug having to do with obnoxious, glaring orbs of light which obscure the avatar and even enemies anytime you step into water, or even in select combat scenarios. Which, as one might imagine, makes fighting enemies a whole lot harder. 

Despite my complaints, it should be telling that I‚Äôve stuck to the game if with its issues. It‚Äôs honesty worth it, and even better if you don‚Äôt encounter the same problems. As of now, I just hope the developers will I find time to fix things. If they get there, I‚Äôll change my review to 5 stars.",4,"Fantastic content, but hampered by IOS glitches",2020-10-17 07:07:34,False

9937,Smiffleblurf,"As a game producer in mobile for over 10 years, I‚Äôm amazed when games like this come across my radar. It just hits all the right notes.  The art direction and style is stunning. The music is enchanting. The battle system feels very ‚ÄúTales of‚Äù series-like which combines well with an open world adventure.

If you loved Nintendo‚Äôs Zelda: Breath of the Wild it takes a lot of inspiration from that and builds upon it with depth from a lot of good ideas that other open world RPGs get right.

The two things that I‚Äôm not enjoying. One is its best feature is apparently co-op multiplayer and it‚Äôs locked away behind Adventure Rank 16. Which takes a lot of gameplay time to get to. I even discussed this with a group of game designers and game product professionals and we‚Äôre all in agreement and baffled why such a great feature is locked away until later in the game. Just let us adventure this world with our friends! From a business standpoint this is a unique selling point of this game that stands it apart from those calling it a Zelda clone, but its locked away behind a big grind.

The second aspect I‚Äôm not enjoying and this is a personal preference is Paimon. I grew up on anime as a kid and into my 20‚Äôs back in the 1990‚Äôs, but I also grew out of anime and don‚Äôt watch it much anymore unless it is fresh and groundbreaking. The moment I hear a cutesy spoil brat sounding child character is like nails on a chalkboard. I just can‚Äôt take much of it anymore. It‚Äôs what made Xenoblade Chronicles 2 such torture to complete as a game and mainly why I don‚Äôt play anime styled games anymore because they ALWAYS add a Paimon-like character. It‚Äôs obnoxious on the deepest level for me and seriously team, if you are reading this, I‚Äôd gladly pay you $5,000 for the ability to disable Paimon. You think I‚Äôm kidding, but its such a trite anime trope and there other voice directions to go in than that after 30 years of anime watching.

Overall, I really love this game and I love how this game is cross-platform. So if you intend to switch between playing this on your phone, tablet, and PC then sign up with a miHoYo account first. If you sign-up up using other methods first it‚Äôll likely force you into a position to start over in order to play cross-platform.",4,"Stunning game, but its best feature is held back",2020-10-05 00:03:49,False
9938,GetBetterServers,"This game is getting praised way too much right now. Definitely has potential and very fun gameplay but the pull rates are abysmal and the game is just too unfinished right now. Around AR30 it becomes way less fun as the story just stops at a random point and the systems in place such as the resin system deter you from even actually playing the game. 120 resin cap with some bosses costing 60 resin and a full resin recharge taking ~14 hours. And the drops aren‚Äôt even that good. Leveling and ascending at this point is just unfun and the devs don‚Äôt even let you grind anything. I reached the point where I can‚Äôt upgrade my characters because I can‚Äôt farm materials because I don‚Äôt have any resin left. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want you to play their game. Chests are just full of junk that don‚Äôt help at all at that point too. Co-op is a buggy mess and there‚Äôs not really a good reason to do it at all, besides some stupid co-op puzzles around the world. This game really doesn‚Äôt deserve a 1* review but neither does it deserve a 4* or even 5* currently. It‚Äôs amazing up until around AR25 but after that it feels like the devs are trying to ruin your fun. I am amazed this has such good reviews right now and I really hope the devs can still make this a great game. Even if they just fix the resin system that would be awesome. Hopefully I can come back and give this game a 5* review because it really has the potential. Really hope I can come back after the 1.1 and 1.2 patches and say that my complaints have been fixed.",1,Unfun after reaching AR30,2020-10-08 09:12:27,False

9972,rejected princess,"I grinded for over a week collecting primogems. You get a 0.6% chance of getting a five star, so you‚Äôre lucky to even get one in the time this game has been released (unless you reroll). I got a five star today. It was a five star weapon that was absolutely, utterly useless to me. I have no use for it. I didn‚Äôt want it. 

Absolutely greedy and trashy. It shouldn‚Äôt be this miserable to pull a five star. There is absolutely no excuse for this. This game would be lovely if it weren‚Äôt for the greediness of the devs. You barely get any primogems, not unless you fork over obscene amounts of money of course. There are so many other gacha games who are generous. Why? You‚Äôre going to turn off your player base with this crap. I get that this is how gacha is but as someone who‚Äôs played many gacha games this is the greediest I‚Äôve seen by far. Who wants to play this game if 70% of the better characters are locked away and virtually impossible to get unless you‚Äôre insanely lucky?

Rant over. This game is so much fun and has so much going for it but the sheer impossibility of getting even ONE five star is utterly insane to me. Again, I understand how gacha games go. But the rates plus how little primogems we‚Äôre able to obtain makes this game just not worth playing. Don‚Äôt bother with this game if you have a gambling addiction, either.

10018,Rouppy20,"I‚Äôd like to say off the bat that this game is beyond what I had expected for a free to play game in multiple areas, it had gave me many hours of content already and I will enjoy this game to come in the near future as long as I don‚Äôt feel like the game is going in a awful direction and as is, it might if the resin system isn‚Äôt fixed in some way.

If you use Reddit or are some platform that is social and is about Genshin impact you probably know many are upset with the resin system. The problem with it is that you can barely do much or get much for the amount you spend and must wait. This mainly affects those that have gathered most chests and completed the story such as myself when we‚Äôre at the end game and have nothing else but to grind out artifacts and mats for various things. An issue here is there are tons of things you need to make so little progress with the resin you will have available due to how slow resin regenerates and since you don‚Äôt get extra by completing a daily or other source that is consistent throughout the day.

Many will say ‚Äúthis is a gacha/F2P game...‚Äù and my rebuttal is that yes this is a gacha/F2P game but it‚Äôs also one that is on console and PC and that alone should not warrant it as an excuse to let slide by. The energy system of this game is far worse than many other mobile games I‚Äôve played, in others I could get extra energy from dailies or simply by logging in or other means allowing me to play for more than 10 minutes. This poses a bigger issue that this is on console and PC that it may take minutes to boot up a pc or console to log in, in the first place, and that you don‚Äôt boot up a pc or consoles for get comfortable to play a game for 10 minutes. 

I will leave it here but I encourage many to stop giving this game a pass just cause ‚Äúit‚Äôs a gacha/F2P game‚Äù cause that is a poor excuse seeing as other games have the same system yet I can log in for much longer and get far more done than I can in this game. This game is tons of fun but right now it‚Äôs being summed down by a system that will make many stop playing in the future and potentially many customers down the road with this system as is.

PS: This game has many more problems that should be addressed besides just the resin system but for now this is one of the bigger ones and shouldn‚Äôt affect newer players too badly till after they complete the story so far.",3,Amazing game bogged down by a bad system,2020-10-12 10:42:49,False

10052,C..S..,"The amount of good things is too long to list, but each of those things are severely overshadowed by the hollow feeling and buyers remorse one feels spending any amount of money or after playing for a couple/few weeks. 

A fundamental flaw w/Genshin is their progression/summoning system. 

Yes you get chars, yes all are usable, yes the game front loads and yes you can probably reroll for 1-2 5*‚Äôs albeit a massive nuisance. 

The issue is being able to build these things as gear drops & gear stats are plagued with disproportunatly awful RNG outcomes. Beyond that- your account level scales passively as you play and the difficulty of the game scales as well- if you were not fortunate enough to get adaquate gear drops within a given time frame the game will gradually scale beyond your ability to keep up... in other words- the dungeons you grind for gear may eventually become the very reason you can no longer handle fighting in those very same dungeons, depending on how lucky your gear drops were within a given window.  (At least one my experience so far) 

As for the summoning, we‚Äôll just forget that beyond week one. This is with out a doubt one of the most disappointing aspects of Genshin for me. If there is a summoning system I would like to use it on occasion, but thanks to their progression system it would take you nearly a year to earn enough resources to reach the point you have a 50% shot to get the featured 5* banner unit. Iirc 40 currency per day, 160 for a single pull, takes 14,400 to hit pity, once you do there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll even be the banner unit. To their credit- each 10 pulls gives a guaranteed 4* weapon or character, which is nice- though probably a less than enjoyable outcome given the amount of time it takes to reach that goal. 

This was with out a doubt the most enjoyable first week I‚Äôve ever experienced in a mobile game to date, unfortunately the level of disappointment, that‚Äôs more than likely, via summoning and gear acquisition - may leave you with too little motivation to even play eventual unlockable/new content. 

If you are they type of player that enjoys slow progression models and does not mind fairly limited access to essential dungeons this may be the perfect game for you.",3,"Was 4/5, now 3/5",2020-11-15 17:49:04,False

That said, the game world is absolutely beautiful. The open world exploration is similar to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It‚Äôs fun to explore the open game world and enjoy the views. The music is excellent and really adds to the finely crafted ambience. There are plenty of things to collect, puzzles to solve, enemies to fight, achievements to unlock, and quests to complete. 

The main story is engaging and the playable characters are distinct and memorable, each with their own backstory and personality quirks. The combat is fast paced and strategically interesting. The combat systems of elemental interactions, character swapping, the variety of character abilities, and equippable weapons and artifacts combine to provide interesting options to play around with and experiment with different strategies.

Overall, an excellent game. But still, I‚Äôll reiterate my warning from above: you may want to stay away from this game if you have ever had a gambling addiction or think you may be at risk for developing one. They give you a lot of free chances with the in-game gambling: the ‚Äòwish‚Äô system.

Unfortunately, this game did not live up to all the hype and it in fact was disappointing. With global launches other games have been extremely more generous. For starters. But this game isn't at all giving with its launch rewards, and it is heavily geared towards the pay to play gamers. With that being said the players that pay will be disappointed! The rates for obtaining good characters and the in game currency is outrageously bad and expensive. The monthly pass also is too much money for too little rewards. Besides terribly low rates, the gameplay is a bit awkward. Besides the expensive in game currency, and awkward clunky controls, I was under the impression that this game would have a luscious open world sprawling with monsters. That‚Äôs what was so heavily marketed about this game anyways. What a letdown! This game has an open world albeit a barren one. With the exception of the few slimes there‚Äôs not that many monsters. So you basically run around a huge open world... With extremely low drop rates, expensive summons, a bad monthly pass, and few monsters to do battle with this game offers nothing new to the market besides a new for an initial product for a  PVE gacha game.

10117,JasMight,"I love this game, because with the amazing graphics, lovable characters, and detailed story, it really does make you feel like you‚Äôre part of another world. BUT THEY NEED TO FIX THE CRASHING ISSUE. It crashes every 15 min or so. I have an iPhone 8, which is by no means old in 2020.

For anyone already playing the game, you‚Äôll understand my pain when I tell you I rage-deleted the game after a certain thing happened: I accidentally increased to world level 3 before ascending my characters to handle that level (btw, it‚Äôs unfair that they don‚Äôt allow you to bring it back down). Instead I had to grind a bit to strengthen their weapons. Started fighting an Oceanid, which I had struggled with before. Every few seconds, I had to restore health or revive my characters, that thing was so tough. I used up more than half of everything I had. Then, just when two in my team were dead, and I had to wait a few more seconds to use another revive, the game had to ‚ÄúRECONNECT TO SERVER‚Äù which often happens at random, but especially when you‚Äôre afk. I freaked out, wondering where I would respawn...

The game brought me back to before I had even approached the Oceanid‚Äôs platform, but    THREE OF MY CHARACTERS WERE DEAD.

COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. After that I was like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm done.‚Äù And deleted it. Maybe I‚Äôll come back to it someday, maybe in a few months when I‚Äôve calmed down and I can‚Äôt remember why a silly video game made me so upset in the first place. But right now I just can‚Äôt do it. If I want to know what happens next in the story, I might just watch someone else‚Äôs walkthrough.

Someone please fix this, because it‚Äôs making the game unplayable.",3,DELETED‚ÄîALWAYS CRASHING,2020-11-01 14:30:16,False

10146,jtomeck,"So since launch I was enamored with this game. Incredible graphics, cool heroes, insanely expansive world, cross play. All amazing things. There's so much to do and it's a lot of fun, I have to admit.

The co-op system leaves a little bit to be desired though. That's my only real knock to the gameplay. You really can't do much together or experience the story together. You can only free roam or run repetitive dungeons together. That said the gameplay is still fun and great.

Here's where my review starts to take a turn. I feel kinda anxious every time I load up the game. The ""battle pass"" has pretty tedious and mundane daily and weekly tasks that is not really fun and I don't want to do. Like ""run around the huge world and collect 200 rare plants,"" or something like that. That's not fun, that's work. Maybe it's because I'm 34 and have a full time job... I don't want my games to be a second job.

The next thing is the summoning rates. Gachas in general prey on people's anxiety and addictions, and although I still play them and love them, this game is absolutely disgusting with how much you have to spend to get anything good... Unless you're ridiculously lucky or skip a banner or two to save for the pity system. The game doesn't even have PvP or like a clan system, so what's the point of spending $7,500 (the amount a content creator I've been watching spent on his account and stopped spending because of how gross this game is) to get all the 5* heroes and get really strong? There's no competition.

So my advice is: Definitely play this game, it's amazing and fun. Just don't fall for the gacha gimmicks.

1.) Don't spend money and fuel the greedy, predatory and completely unnecessary gacha system.
2.) Get familiar with and learn to love three starter heroes.
3.) Don't get excited for a new hero release unless you have enough currency for 90 summons (I think that's pity).
4.) Play the game at your own pace. There's no reason to build up quick and get strong because there's no competitive play

10151,MC barbar/kyea/amber/traveler,"All in all. 11/10 game. It‚Äôs quirky. It‚Äôs fun. ITS ENJOYABLE. the problem is it‚Äôs not sustainable for f2p casual players beyond the initial feeling and gameplay. You can play the game through with the free toons they give you but it‚Äôs going to take you 20x times as long to do it compared to a person that spends between 500 to 1000 in Gacha drops. Those drops are not promised to be lucrative characters though either unfortunately you could get 3 or 4 doubles of the free to play characters(or the same f2p character over and over) you have or in worse cases nothing at all beyond weapons you can already farm in game. You know what I can‚Äôt farm in game? A character or combination of characters that have a move set that doesn‚Äôt feel like a wet noodle hitting a hitting the pay wall. 

To be fair. I FULLY went into this expecting the free to play characters to be underwhelming. They always are in games like this. What I didn‚Äôt expect was the 1/million chance to roll a unique character on a case by case basis...... I‚Äôm heartbroken that I can‚Äôt build a team that feels like mine because I haven‚Äôt seen anything unique. I've played the game up to ar30 so far and I haven‚Äôt seen a new character. Now I‚Äôm in the home stretch to end game and I hit like a wet noodle unless I‚Äôm using the only combo team they give you. The water healer nun Barbra and the ice swordsman kyea. (Definitely butchered the names) 

I think there‚Äôs one other team comp I could use and it‚Äôs geo/geo using noelle and the traveler but from what I can tell it‚Äôs only kind of comparable in damage with another geo character to help with shields. That comes back to the root of the problem though!!!! 

How can I play the game and use the designed mechanics of what I‚Äôm given barely scratches the surface and the wish system punishes me for not spending money.(or from what I‚Äôve seen online it punishes you for not spending to get the pity 5 star. Which is even more scary. On top of that it‚Äôs not promised to be a character either unless you use the right banner which is a whole different kind of annoying)

Needless to say I‚Äôm upset because I LOVE THIS GAME but I don‚Äôt like the vicious tactics to get you to spend a lot of money for no reward. 

Please balance your free to play base team or fix the wish system drops. One or the other could go a long way to making this more sustainable. 

So please for the love of god change the rates or balance your game.",3,Will change to 5 if they change wishes OR balancing in mechanics happens,2020-10-18 06:59:00,False

10177,4447659,"TLDR: this game is so close to being special but it has some serious flaws.

Is Genshin Impact a good game? Yes.

Is it a good Gacha game? I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say. 

Genshin impact is arguably one of the most ambitious mobile games on the App Store and it does so much right but it also falls flat in certain departments.

The combat is simple yet fun, the elemental attack system that relies on blending different elements to do different types of combo damage reminds me a lot of Mass Effect Andromeda‚Äôs ability combo system. (arguably the only thing that game did incredibly well)

The character and world designs are great. Liyue is one of the prettiest environments I‚Äôve seen in any mobile game and it even beats some console and PC titles. 

One of the core problems with the game lies in its progression system. Simply put, it‚Äôs incredibly pedestrian. Adventure rank is easy enough to raise but the problem lies in the fact that the game locks a lot of resource farming behind AR 20 and 30+. This is a problem because it slows down player growth significantly and halts you from ascending your characters to higher and higher levels. My next gripe with the progression system is the battle pass because I feel like it is unlocked at a really awkward point in time at AR 20, and there are a lot of useful items that newer players could use to get through the main story.

The area where this game truly face plants though is in its gacha system, simply put. Hard pass on whaling, at least for now. I got all of my bonus currency from buying each currency pack for the first time and I can safely say that the current 5 star rates are so bad that you might as well just shoot for maxing out 4 star constellations and ignore most 5 star characters, and I got lucky and managed to get several 5 star pulls, I even got one node within the constellation of a 5 star character. The gacha system needs to be retuned for be a bit more consumer friendly if Mihoyo wants players to use characters other then Fischl and Xiangling who are incredibly easy to obtain while also being ludicrously powerful with constellation points. There should be a realistic chance to get a 5 star character or weapon without breaking the bank and as of right now, there isn‚Äôt.

If the gacha rates and progression system get tweaked so that they value players time more then this game is a must play but until the gacha system is made a bit fairer, I can only give this game a 3 star review.",3,Great but needs tweaking,2020-10-06 23:59:08,False

10190,This is what you call KARMA,"I‚Äôm going to start off with this - my friends and I absolutely ADORE this game. It‚Äôs the hot topic of the month, and we‚Äôre all having a blast playing it. The music, the visuals, the story, the characters, and the gameplay are all so good even for a mobile player like me. However, there are definitely a nick that worries me very much. I understand that this game is still in its very early stages, but please take these into consideration:

The Gacha 
I understand that a gacha system is a very good source of income and is also not too much of a deal in the actual gameplay (the game can be progressed with the F2P and common gacha characters), the rates and systems surrounding the gacha are putrid and can be perceived as predatory. 0.6% for a 5 star (with weapons and characters mixed together!) and a 90 for a pity in addition to the very expensive gacha currency of primogems both in terms of real life money and in-game accumulation, it would be an understatement to call this gacha system harsh. As this game is marketed for a very wide audience outside of the regular audience of gacha games, this is a major turnoff for many new players of gacha and even some of the old veterans. I do not have enough information of balancing a gacha game so I cannot give any specific advice, but some more generosity should go a long way.

There are definitely other minor problems such as not being able to find the objective of a quest for almost a hour even with I look all around (I still can‚Äôt find the wind clusters on the uninhabited island), several glitches such as suddenly launching into the air during combat, and the very limited co-op of this game. However, I know that these problems are either because of my shortcomings or just because this is a very new game. From what I heard from Honkai Impact players, the game developers here seem to be very generous, so I hope to see more improvements to the generosity of the game.

10204,Osserc31,"I want to love this game. It gets 3 stars for being a mihoyo game alone.  An ambitious developer and I think one of the most technically adept mobile developers on the planet. Genshin impact is a nice looking game, smooth animations, very pretty. There are some interesting elemental interactions in the world and combat system. Occasionally those can be annoying and needlessly draw out fights that should be simple, but for the most part it‚Äôs actually a pretty cool set of mechanics. 

However, some very fundamental flaws hold it back from being a great game. One problem, unfortunately, is how amazing mihoyo‚Äôs previous game is, Honkai 3rd Impact.  While genshin looks good, it cannot compare to how visually stunning Honkai is. Likely a conscious art style decision, and maybe not a fair comparison, but it is the truth. Honkai is very much console level stunning across the board, and genshin does not compete.  But I could easily forgive this. 

The real problem, is the writing and story.  The characters, the story, the dialogue, everything is as cliche as you can possibly get. It feels like this was written by teenagers for ten year olds. Character designs are childish, dialogue is not even surface level interesting let alone provided with some depth of thought and context. The story so far has zero nuance, not a single interesting hook. I feel like I‚Äôm playing a children‚Äôs book, and not even a good children‚Äôs book. 

Perhaps I‚Äôm being too hard on a mobile game. But my expectations for mihoyo are much higher than other developers. They are SO GOOD that they get compared to themselves. There is a lot of garbage out there on mobile, and even with the things I don‚Äôt like this game is far and away better than most mobile games. But I am disappointed that mihoyo has deviated from the maturity and nuance that made the world of Honkai so interesting and absorbing. I can‚Äôt get into the same cliche story that‚Äôs been used in 1000 other Eastern RPGs. I cannot care about sickly sweet or suave cool cliche characters that are part of every Eastern RPG for the last 20 years.  

I still adore mihoyo as a developer, one of the best out there no doubt.  But this game does not hit the mark for me.",3,Regression,2020-10-12 03:13:54,False

10243,justdanieln,"I really like the game don't get me wrong. The characters are well designed. The story is interesting and the open world is amazing. But, there are a few big things that are holding me back from giving the game a high rating. 

The first issue is the camera angles. Mid battle, especially on a hill or incline, the camera keeps deciding to just look into the ground rather than showing the enemy/fight. 

Next is the landscape. Again, it's beautiful, but when fighting enemies, if they slip, they would get clipped on the side of the hill and just stay there. They respawn if you run far enough but it gets frustrating to fight it again if it was a boss monster. 

Next would be the combat. The lock on mechanic is so frustrating. I would be aiming for the enemy in front of me and my attack decides to hit the one far in the back or on structures. The combat response is spotty. I would hold for a charged attack but instead the character just stands there. Abilities are spotty too with the same issue. Maybe it is not prevalent on PC. I really like Honkai impact and thought that it had one of the best combat mechanics and I assumed Genshin would be the same. Nope.

The response of the buttons on mobile is really janky. I would jump off a cliff to glide and when holding the glide button, it doesn't register. Even when repeatedly holding the glide button as I fall wasn't registering and I end up dying. It gets annoying when you thought you pressed a button on the game but it does not even go through. 

Overall the game is beautiful hands down and the best open world on mobile available. The character design is top notch. But the issues I had makes playing a game a chore and something that I don't look forward to playing cause it's gonna be aggravating.",2,Great Game but Has Become Frustrating,2020-10-27 15:59:07,False

10273,sjhahn,"I would give this game 1 star but it gets another star for beautiful in-game designs. The open world plays and looks beautiful. 

However, gameplay is....stale. Out of all the elements available, only one is really truly viable as a dps and with endgame content being a DPS stat check, team design is not as flexible as the developers market it to be. 

On the topic of the developers...there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being profit-driven. However, the issue lies not in their values but their lack of respect for the customer player base and the silencing of dissent. After the release of a character that many people saved and paid for, they waited several days to release a statement which said absolutely nothing. They pay content creators to back them up as white knights and then even went as far as to censor words that could bring attention or inconvenience to their playerbase‚Äôs frustration. 

Let‚Äôs also not forget that many players have had their personal information (phone numbers and email addresses) leaked and many accounts being hacked and resold because the devs are very very stubborn about not implementing two factor authentication. Accounts with thousands of real dollars hacked because the devs made linked phone numbers and emails visible to anyone who wanted to look for them. And on top of all this, they make putting in a ticket reporting that your account was hacked and resold basically a trash can. 

I want to recommend this game because it is a beautiful game. But with the precedence that Zhongli has placed, I think it‚Äôs better for you, someone reading this review, to skip out on this game. Why play a game that is focused on funneling money to the devs when they will do absolutely nothing for you as the player. Sorry, let me rephrase that: why give the devs money to play a game that they have given up on themselves? It‚Äôs a sinking ship with a terrible endgame, abysmal security, and a dictatorial and stubborn development team with no direction.

10276,Swippss,"I recently decided to pick up this game a few days after its launch after hearing all of the hype surrounding it and wishing to experience this game for myself. I want to begin by saying that this game is absolutely stunning, there‚Äôs no denying that one bit. However, my grievances with this game begin in the app store, more specifically with the expansive list of compatible devices.

It is the opposite.

I have seen many reviews made by players with older iPhone and iPad models, my iPhone 6 included, having difficulty even starting the game, much less actually playing it. This can likely be chalked up to our older models being ill-equipped for an app of this size, but I have seen reviews of people with the more recent iPhone 8 saying that the game lags horrifically to the point of being unplayable. I would expect an app, especially one with the degree of anticipation it had before launch, to be properly stress-tested with older Apple products to confirm exactly which ones are able to run the app and which ones are not.

This problem of older models not being able to run apps that they are supposed to be able to is not exclusive to Genshin, however. I had to delete a similarly recent release, Masketeers, as my device was unable to run that app as well despite being marked as compatible. The difference between Masketeers and Genshin for me, however, is the developer aid provided by the two apps. The developers of Masketeers can be seen responding to the problems the reviewers of their app have and making attempts to remedy said problems. Genshin has no such developer response. I have scrolled through the reviews for Genshin for 10+ minutes and have seen not one developer response to either a negative review with a problem nor any of the majority positive reviews praising the game.

To me, this is unacceptable developer behavior.

I will unfortunately be forced to download Genshin on my PC just to experience what this game truly is; at least until the game is released on the Switch. I hope miHoYo will address the problems its mobile players are experiencing in the near future, as currently there is only the void to shout our grievances into.",2,Mislead and Disappointed,2020-10-09 07:13:54,False

10307,Huitz1lo,"I‚Äôm rating it 2 stars because at its core, Genshin Impact is a Breath of the Wild knockoff with a big gacha emphasis and the sad reality is that most gacha games.. aren‚Äôt good. This is different in a sense that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù game (disregarding the fact that it‚Äôs still significantly lacking content but it‚Äôs a only month old) but you have gamble to progress. Unlike other games where you can auto-farm gear, Genshin has to gatekeep gear behind the gacha system. This means you either pay for the rolls with real money (the easiest way) or grind out the resources needed to roll for better gear somehow (the most tedious). You best bet that the developers are NOT generous with said resources/gambling currency either, known as Primogems, as you need a significant amount of them for just ONE summon. Other gachas have better rates than Genshin.

The characters are also behind this same gacha system. That means in order for you to play with new characters you either pay for the rolls or again, grind out the resources (which also uses Primogems). Genshin has set up the character banners so that you don‚Äôt just roll for characters but also weapons as well. Personally, this is the worst kind of trickery there is because if you‚Äôre rolling for a character, it‚Äôs likely you'll summon an unwanted weapon. And they‚Äôre not necessarily good weapons either. Other gachas have done it better by having separate banners for characters/units and everything else.

In addition, the summoning rates in this game are awful. IIRC, there‚Äôs a 0.6% chance that you‚Äôll summon a 5 star character in this game. This is ridiculous as it‚Äôs possible to never summon the unit you want.

Overall, the game itself is decent while lacking a lot of content but the gacha itself is extremely anti-Free2Play. Stay if you‚Äôre interested in a Breath of the Wild rip-off but that‚Äôs about it.",2,"Decent game, awful gacha",2020-11-02 09:40:01,False

10311,Septembug,"Genshin Impact is fantastic... for about the first week or so. I‚Äôm speaking as someone who frequently plays gachas and open-world exploration games, and Genshin Impact has so much going for it. It has a fantastically amazing world that you can tell a lot of work went into, a good soundtrack, lively characters/NPCs, and all for the low price of absolutely free. I‚Äôm currently AR34 and while I started this game a little after launch, I‚Äôve gotten quite far in terms of how I compare to other players.

All of that being said, there are some very glaring issues that start to pop up once you surpass AR30 and finish the main story. This will be said a thousand times over, across multiple platforms, but the stamina system (called Resin in-game) is really atrocious. Most gachas or free to download games have some sort of stamina system that limits you from just min-maxing and going full hardcore until you burn out and quit. That makes it completely understandable that a game would implement one - but Genshin is in a weird spot. While I write this on an app review page the fact of the matter is that this game was released across THREE platforms: phones, pc, and console (currently only PS4 but the Switch version will come eventually). And while phone games have an established history of limiting playtime to incentivize spending, pc and console games do NOT. So this has set the player base at odds with itself where the stamina system is somewhat acceptable for people who play exclusively on their phones, but completely alienates the enormous amount of players who experience this game through pc and console. The stamina system is severely limiting, with high refresh time and an extremely low cap relative to the amount needed to complete domains and the like. It NEEDS to be reworked, plain and simple, and Mihoyo has been completely ignoring the complaints they get about this across both the English and Chinese speaking communities. No statement, no acknowledgement of the problems, nothing. The lack of transparency is what truly hurts them the most and is what will kill this game ultimately.

But the stamina system is not the only thing this game has issues with. Character level progression is nearly impossible once you get to the current endgame/mid-game as the only way to increase the strength of your characters is by spending Mora (the in-game currency of Genshin). Mora becomes extremely scarce after AR30, as the loot system does NOT scale properly to your current level. This means that people who are at the stage where leveling a single character takes more than 300k Mora no longer have a loot system that can support that kind of spending. And even if you wanted to level your characters the old-fashion way via fighting enemies in the open world, the amount of EXP you receive after every battle is hilariously small. Barely a drop in the bucket - and that‚Äôs even true for characters who are starting at level 1! AR30+ progression is essentially forced to a standstill for the worst reasons, and this is a problem that will only become worse as more of the player base reaches that point. This problem will especially rear its ugly head after more content gets added to the game.

And now the final issue is somewhat a result of the two mentioned above: the gacha. The current rate of summoning the highest rarity characters (Genshin uses a star system to rate rarity, 5 star being the highest) is an abysmal 0.5%. Now, Genshin is NOT the first game to have horrendously low gacha rates. Fate Grand Order is one of the most popular and financially successful gacha games ever made, and their own gacha has a pull rate comparable to Genshin‚Äôs. But the reason FGO‚Äôs gacha works is because players are willing to risk it. Why? Because the player base is allowed the opportunity to build their characters with much more liberty, thus fostering a situation where they are attached to those characters and the teams they‚Äôve created. When the player base is allowed the opportunity to grow attached to these characters they‚Äôve spent money on or summoned via their free to play currency, it makes them more willing to roll for new characters via the gacha. But with the Resin and Mora situations being what they are, no one is allowed the opportunity to play frequently enough or to build their characters in Genshin Impact. And to make matters even worse, 100 USD is only enough to buy you 50 summons in a system where it takes 90 summons to get a guaranteed 5 star. 

I could go on and on about this, but you get the point. Genshin Impact has so much potential but it has so much holding it back from being the best game of 2020 and beyond. At the rate its going at, many players will simply quit if these issues aren‚Äôt addressed and Genshin will be a fleeting memory by the time the actual big games of late 2020 become the center of attention. If by the next major patch (Early November) we don‚Äôt have some changes announced, this game is doomed to a very early grave. And it truly breaks my heart to see so, especially with such a beautiful game like this one.",2,A game with great potential but is held back,2020-10-16 14:56:03,False

10387,_Astarte_,"To cut it short. For one, I have played many games online that makes use of amazing graphics, without lag. This game has it so bad. It looks like the developers simply rushed it out without any optimizations. Even the settings menu does not work well. Now for another thing, which this is the most unintelligent play I have seen yet. The settings menu is locked to story progression. Given with the lag this game has. I am quite certain a lot simply left the game off the bat due to this one thing.

If I cannot even play the game properly. Then this game does not even deserve a single star. Unfortunately, I am forced to give it a star. To add on, the game is not properly optimized for iPad as well. Being stuck on a white blank screen for minutes before being able to enter. To add on, crashing on top of this. Frequently as well.

Honestly, unless some very basic implementations are made. This game is one of the worst ones out there. Simply due to what has been stated here.

Now aside from this, this game has even more problems. While pushing through, crashing every ten minutes, sometimes even less. For a single player game, it has a ton of walls. An illusion of an open world masquerading with the usual shady tactics of others mobile games. 

The adventure rank is possibly one of the worst implementations I have seen. Which halts to game to a near unplayable level. Ya know, not counting the whole crashing thing. Then on top of this, characters and weapons are mixed in with the same banners and whatnot. Naturally, power division as to entice others to spend. Never going to spend now I will let you know. 

The storyline just feels like it is dragging on. Given with the adventure rank limitations. Then do not get me started on the resin system. This is by far a very shady game. Using the elements of an open world as to create an illusion of limitless play. Lacking in balance on top of that, not to an extreme degree I will say. Overall, this game is simply another scam out there. I will not even call it a game anymore. With that being said, I am finished with it. To those reading this. Realize this is a system marketing on your addiction to keep going back into it, and spending. 

So long as you keep supporting this. They will keep bringing these games lacking quality in play and engagement. The only difference is that they waited a bit longer than usual, but it will come at one point or another. It has been a while since I wrote such a review. While the game started out with promise, like many others. It quickly falls into one of the worst, disgusting practices out there. Honestly, for a single player game. I should have seen this coming at one point or another. 

Lacking polish all around, and cannot even maintain a line of consistency like the beginning. The adventure rank limiting progress. The resin system furthering this. The open world feeling more like a chore than for fun. The power imbalance of the characters. It goes on and on.",1,Pretty Much One of The Worst I Have Played,2020-11-03 07:27:01,False

10392,Wa 7,"Let me start with the positive aspects. The combat is decent. I had fun playing it at least. Those are the only positive things I have to say.

Now for the negative. The game is boring. There are no good characters, no real challenges and no compelling story. The ‚Äúopen world‚Äù isn‚Äôt even open. There are areas of the map that Paimon won‚Äôt let you go into. Speaking of Paimon, she‚Äôs next. She‚Äôs like those annoying guides from Zelda like Navi or Fi, except ten times worse. Always constantly nagging with the most annoying voice. I guess I need to address the elephant in the room. THIS GAME IS A SHAMELESS ZELDA RIP OFF. I‚Äôm not too upset about this, but they stole entire themes from breath of the wild. Such as the monsters, map, Goddess statues(which double as towers), cooking, camps, materials, the gliding, and even the way ore deposits look. Not to mention the entire art style of the game which looks like it was copy pasted from Zelda.

As I said, the game is boring. The characters are bland, the entire story feels lame. There isn‚Äôt even a streamlined story, it‚Äôs all over the place! There are no objectives after awhile and if you explore there‚Äôs nothing intriguing to find and nothing fun to do. It‚Äôs just bland. It‚Äôs dry. It‚Äôs the same thing over and over.

There is no personality, passion, or love put into this game. It‚Äôs awful. I did have some fun playing it, but I have no interest in going on. I feel like I‚Äôve already experienced everything and I‚Äôve barely started the game. But please, download the game and see for yourself. Maybe you‚Äôll find it fun. It‚Äôs not a scam or a rip-off.

10416,Destroyer891,"The game starts out great showering you with free summons and resources but once you hit level 29+ with all quests completed there is nothing to do besides 4 dailies each day that takes roughly 10-15 minutes in total and 2-3 bosses/4-5 dungeon entries and you are out of resin (stamina for this game) for the rest of the day. Resources are scarce that you really can only focus on 2-3 characters otherwise you won‚Äôt have enough to be on par with enemy levels when you ascend world levels with your main team.

They released their first co op event a few weeks ago but it was poorly optimized that players were glitching out while playing. They have been releasing some small login and events where you get a couple free resin refills and some gems for 1-2 gacha pulls but that is about it to compensate their poor resin system and low gacha rate issues that are known by the majority of the community.

The game has a great open world with interesting characters with unique skills and personalities but with very low rates on characters and limited resources to level them with you won‚Äôt be able to level and experience all of them for months to a year+ unless you are willing to open up that wallet. 

It is a great breath of the wild clone that does some things better but also takes two steps back with its severely time-gated resin system and scarce resources for you to enjoy playing multiple characters and doing some meaningful progress in the game unless you spend money on resin refills to get an average amount of gameplay for late game.",1,Ruined by Monetization,2020-10-30 01:35:37,False

10447,Meowtain Cat,"I want to start by saying that I loved Genshin Impact. The world is beautiful, the story line is intriguing, and the characters are fun to play. But Mihoyo is making me re-consider all the things I loved about the game, and regret the money I‚Äôve spent.

There are a lot of security issues. Accounts are getting constantly hacked, and numerous vulnerabilities keep getting reported (most recent being the public email exploit). Although Mihoyo eventually comes to fix the security concerns as they come up, it still refuses to create 2 step authentication. How can I feel secure about spending money, when I have to live in fear of getting my account stolen? 

Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt care about it‚Äôs customers. There are numerous complaints about limited resources, unfair drops, and expensive characters. $200 guarantees one instance of a 5 star character. If you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs insane, Mihoyo also limits the power of characters with their constellations. Zhongli, for example is so weak, that you need at least a constellation of one to have him be acceptable. For a full constellation, that‚Äôs $1200. And that‚Äôs only for the limited banner character. Your money definitely doesn‚Äôt get you far in this game, unless you‚Äôre willing to pay in the thousands. 

The app also crashes all the time, making it impossible to complete my dailies.

TLDR. You should definitely play the game, but don‚Äôt use your email to create an account and make sure not to spend any money on this game.",1,"Great game, terrible company",2020-12-07 21:07:56,False

10451,Kobalstromo,"At the start of the game, everything is pretty good due to quest rewards and low costs to upgrade your characters, however.

Cons- 

Insanely predatory pull system: 
0.6% chance to get a 5 star item, guaranteed at 90pulls, however, it‚Äôs only a 50% chance to get the ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù item from your 90th pity pull. So it isn‚Äôt even a pity pull.
- what this means:
‚Äî oh boy that unit looks really fun, can‚Äôt wait to spend around 400$ to get one. Then I do it 6 more times to get the upgrades for it! 

Abysmal levels of rewards:
Early game your costs to level are low, so you don‚Äôt notice it, but then as the game progresses and enemies get harder, your source of money and exp begins to go away;
Chests only respawn on world rank up.
Leylines do not give anywhere near the amount of mora or exp to be worth the cost involved from resin (I‚Äôll get to resin).
Monsters give 14-20 exp per kill. Mid game leveling a character takes 50k exp per level ish. Hope you‚Äôre ready to grind mobs for a month!
Running the dungeons for the character and weapon advancement materials is also a joke. You spend resin, again, to get a CHANCE to get one or two of the item you need, didn‚Äôt get it? Better wait 2 hours and 40 minutes to try again! ((That is how long it takes for the resin to recharge to pay the cost to attempt the dungeon.))

I could go on. I‚Äôm keeping my eye on this game to see if they will fix the issues that the community is kvetching over by patch 1.1, if they don‚Äôt, it simply proves this is a cash grab game with a lot of effort put in by the art, gameplay, sound, and music teams, only for the business team to utterly destroy their hard work and ruin the game with greed.

TLDR: don‚Äôt get this game in its current form, wait to see if it learns from its horrible mistakes, or dies on its feet. Your wallet and patience will thank me.",1,"Great early game, horrible replay ability.",2020-10-24 17:45:03,False

10453,Errroneous,"The game can be so much better. Yes the game is amazing in so many ways. My biggest complaint is the terrible 0.6% gacha pull rates. So basically you will not pull a 5* except for once every couple months as a free to play. At first this doesn‚Äôt bother you because they give gems with quests. But soon enough you realize unless you pay a lot of money for crystals to pull heroes, you won‚Äôt be getting much. 

Again, to be clear the gacha rate for a 5* is 0.6%. So basically you will never pull a 5* out of luck. You will pull a 5* every 90 pulls. There is a 50% you will get the banner hero you want or another 5* weapon or hero. Or if you don‚Äôt, 90 pulls later you are guaranteed that banner hero. Which almost sounds tolerable. Until you realize you then need 6 more of that 5* to complete their constellation.  Oh and don‚Äôt forget, that 5* might be a weapon, screwing up your whole pity rate.  Eventually you need to buy gems. Which are ridiculously priced for the terrible gacha rates.   There are very few gems given in the game after AR 30. 

I am not a free to play player, but I stopped spending on this game. Even my friends who have played Fire Emblem and other gacha games for years say they are losing interest because it takes so long to pull anything good and the rates are so terrible. 

Wake up Mihoyo and listen to what people are saying. Friends are already quitting because you can‚Äôt manage to figure out how to make reasonable prices and decisions.

The fixes they can make are easy. The truth is I want to spend in this game. The game engine is beautiful, fluid and the best I have seen. Combat I find fun. Characters, art and story are amazing. Just come up with better business practices.

Most of the game can be played with 4* heroes. But at least make some of the 5* heroes accessible to people for decent prices.",1,Terrible gacha rates. Expensive gems.,2020-10-22 16:43:40,False

10485,ArdenBob,"Just wanted to say that this game is really amazing, and has great potential. 

However, at the end of the day, it is still a gacha game with abysmal rates as well as extremely expensive rolls (avg $2 USD per roll). Right now a lot of players aren‚Äôt complaining about this because of the games honeymoon phase but this is detrimental to F2P player base months down the road if Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt address this issue.

Now to address the resin issue. For starters, you can‚Äôt even finish the weekly resin usage missions on the battle pass without spending primogems or fragile resin to refresh. What kind of joke is this if you‚Äôve bought the battle pass? It‚Äôs like paying $10 for the pass, then requiring to spend extra resources/money just to complete the pass. 8 min per 1 resin capped at 120 is a ridiculously low cap and slow regeneration rate even for a gacha game. At least in Fate Grand Order they allow you to raise your cap through levels and let you stack a lot of energy regen materials like golden apples for events for free. 

After AR30, the game becomes super dry in terms of content, I just log in, do dailies, use up resin for 20 min, and just log off. I think this problem will be resolved once new content gets released, but is also a byproduct of the poorly designed resin system. 

I really hope Mihoyo listens to players criticism and feedback. Like I said, this game has great potential, and I want to see it succeed, but this starts with communication and cooperation between the developer and player base.",1,Extremely Predatory Gacha System with Terrible Resin/Energy Regeneration,2020-10-08 03:05:43,False

10498,Fappy216,"On the surface, Genshin seems like a great game. Open world gacha with story, side quests, co-op, and a fun combat style. And the game sells these aspects for awhile pretty successfully. I was enamored with the game for a week. I finished the main story, did all the side quests, tried out all the trials and domains, played around in abyss, and fully explored the map and collected all and oculus and geoculus. I got around adventure level 30 by the time I ran out of quests, and I‚Äôve been collecting chests to get my current rank 34. At this point, there are some pretty glaring issues.
     After fully exploring the map once, the open world aspect is essentially useless. Need to do a domain? Fast travel. Need to do a leyline? Fast travel. World boss? Fast travel. Farming mobs around the world feels pretty useless. They give so little xp that their only worth is they drop some mats to ascend your character. Open world might be fun if chests actually dropped some useful items, but it‚Äôs all trash. On top of that, the chests don‚Äôt seem to respawn. It seems like the only reason to run around the map is to collect ingredients for crafting or ascending one‚Äôs characters.
     Co-op seems pretty useless in this game. The content isn‚Äôt hard enough to warrant using co-op, but you are also pretty limited in the content you can do co-op. Abyss trials seems like something that should be co-op, or at least some similar challenge to play with friends. 
     I‚Äôm not too concerned about running out of story and side quests at this point considering how many hours I played the game and how new it is. 
     Even after playing to this extent, I still really enjoy the combat. Figuring out different combos between the characters is satisfying. But this leads to two more issues. 
     I would love to play and enjoy the combat, but I can‚Äôt because so much content is locked behind resin. Weekly bosses, leylines, field bosses, and domains are all locked behind resin. This might not be problematic in itself, but resin capping out at 120 and being able to make use of 180 resin a day due to how slow it recharges makes the resin mechanic feel extremely bad. I want to be able to grind something in this game. Right now, I‚Äôm forced to log on, do my daily commissions, spend my resin, maybe do some gathering and crafting, log off. Let me play your game please. Make leylines cost no resin. Or make finishing the dailies give you a free resin refill. Something. Please.
     The second additional problem is that you have a great combat system with fun characters, but the gacha rates to get said characters are pretty abysmal. This also might not be a problem if devs were generous in giving out currency, but considering some of the nerfs to getting this currency (chests give less primo now, abyss rerun only gives primo for floors after the initial 8), I think it is definitely a problem.
     I enjoy the game and want to see it succeed, and I really feel that they need to address some of these issues in order to do so.",1,Needs Work,2020-10-08 17:41:05,False

En el 8 es cuando corre bien porque el 5 y 6 estan re mal integrados arreglen esto, el cielo es negro el agua es negra.

Lo que les importo fueron las descargas.

Arreglen el bug, que bug la mala integracion del juego de los iphones de abajo del 8 o si no pongan que no solo se puede correr en los iphones 8 en adelante. 

Lo mas probable es que ustedes an ignorado las peticiones de arreglo desde un mes y si estan trabajando en una actualizaci√≥n que arregle esto me alegro.

11111,Sir_Xirek,"The potential to loose a lot of the time and money you put into the game because of the lack of account security is just embarrassing. To no fault of your own, you could lose your account, unable to get it back due to the developer‚Äôs faulty design. And when you do contact the developer, they do very little to help.

Beyond that, there‚Äôs security concerns involving your personal email and phone number being compromised as long as someone knows your in-game username. Though fixes have been made for the phone number, the lack of account security is still a lingering issue for people who want to put time and money into a game but don‚Äôt want to have that effort be lost due to an amateur hacker.

Aside from these issues, the game is obviously well-made and a lot of passion is put into it. When a greedy corporation collided with passionate and visionary people, you get a game like genshin impact. The characters are well-designed and the world is filled to the brim. But corporate greed takes over when characters are disappointing mechanically despite their aesthetic appeal. Corporate greed takes over when they do nothing to help you recover your account because you didn‚Äôt spend enough.",2,Account Security,2020-12-10 01:44:10,False
11112,Heck No!!!,"Update: I praise this game and it deserves the awards it is getting. But for the love of god, FIX THE CAMERA AND ARCHERS AND BATTERY!!! The camera for battle mode does not seem to do anything. It still swings around really quick constantly, sometimes it gives me a first person point of view, and I have trouble directing my attacks. Which leads to the distance fighters. Their accuracy needs to be improved or give us a lock on option. Too too many times I would have an enemy right in front but if I am not directly in view of that enemy my arrows can go somewhere else. Please fix this and the camera already! Lastly, I feel bad for those playing on phone. This game even on the lowest setting drains your battery instantly. You can get maybe 30 minutes of game time without plugged up on an Ipad Pro maxed out. Maybe this is an IOS software problem but still this needs to be fixed. One more thing; just add controller support already. I and many others can play with touch controls but a controller would make movement and accuracy so so so much better. You allow PC and console players to play with controllers at least give mobile players the option to do so. Love the game and it deserves the recognition and rewards. But please fix these issues. 

Update: Thank you for the update. The bug seems to have been fixed too! Thank yoU.

Update: I love the game but there is a bug in the Equilibrium quest. The slime does not show up. Please fix this ASAP and will change rating.

Update: I briefly touched on this in my first review but will discuss it a little more. This game is a GACHA game which if you want certain characters and weapons, you have to use in world currency. However, to get that currency you have to spend real world money. It is not guaranteed that you will get that character or weapon you want. It is pretty much loot boxing/slot machine. I should mention that there was an update that made it where every 10 times you use the in-game currency, you will get a character or rare weapon. However, through grinding you can get the in-game currency and try to get the rare characters or weapons that way. None and do mean NONE of these characters and weapons are needed to play the game. I would spend no more than $20 and grind the rest of the game. Do not listen to youtubers who spend more than that. For them, it is a tax right off. Spend no more than $20 and grind the rest. Nothing else changes from my previous review. 

WOW!! Just...WOW!!! This is truly proof that mobile games, good ones like this, can compete with console games. Here is my review. The bad and the good. 

The bad:

The only problem I have had thus far is the camera. It hasn‚Äôt been happening much but sometimes when in battle the camera swings behind my character and given that this TPP I could not see my character. Maybe it is just me but in one or two battles I was fighting the camera.

I wish this game did allow controller support. You can play this game with a controller on PC but not on mobile. I have an Ipad Pro 12.9 and although it is not heavy, I do not like holding it for 2-3 hrs while gaming.

Now the good:

This game is just beautiful. This game running on maxed settings is just gorgeous. It has the same art-style as Breath of the Wild which a lot of people loved and this game.........just beautiful. Bright, colorful, shadows, night, day, beautiful. It looks 1000X better than Oceanhorn 2. Also, this world is huge. A lot of open world games on mobile claim to be open world which they are but the world is not that big. This world, you can tell there is a lot of exploring to do especially when you look at the map.

Controls: They are very responsive and love it. My only gripe is I wish a controller can connect to play this game but that may come in the future.

Characters: so far I have 5 characters. I am still in the early stages of the game and heard there are 21. Some say you have to pay for some characters but it looks like you can grind to get them which is what I like cause I am old-school. Also like how with each character they bring certain skills. You have a party of 4 but you must carefully choose who you want. You can have all heavy hitter-close combat fighters but then you have to worry about what element they bring. Some elements do poorly against each other so you will likely have to swap it for your long distance fighter who counters an enemy element. Also, the weapons and gear of each character can be upgraded and you can spend a good 30 minutes trying to determine who needs what upgrade. It is very customizable and I love it. 

Story: the story is rather simple. You end up separated from your sibling and teleport to a different world. You meet certain people who become part of your party that try to help you reunite with your sibling. In doing so, you go on different adventures, quests, face off against different bosses, collect items etc. I will admit; I would be trying to do a main quest and on the way to the location I would get distracted and do a side quest...and another side quest, and another side quest....lol. 

This game is worth downloading, it is worth playing, and I am surprised they are not charging for it. I will spend some money in the game in the near future because you can tell that this game was made with love. And the creators just wanted you to have fun playing this game.

11125,Renkinjutsushi,"This game is really great in theory. It has an amazing world, amazing characters, and amazing plot- it makes you want to keep playing. 

One issue is the paywall behind the characters. They advertise the game with characters like Childe, Venti, etc., but in actuality it costs upwards of $200-400 to actually secure one of them. Further, they‚Äôve showed extremely poor customer support relating to the new character Zhongli, showing that the general direction of the game is likely not a positive, user-friendly one. 

Another issue is safety. It appears that users can very easily be hacked, their account content stolen, their e-mails on display for everyone to see. It‚Äôs dangerous. 

The drop rates for 5 stars need to be better, they need to fix the resin issue, they need to fix Zhongli, they need to help protect their users from hackers, hide our e-mails. They need to listen to what their userbase is saying. It‚Äôs very clear that right now it‚Äôs less about us and more about money.

Huge
-security problem hacker can see your email and phone number this problem is still ongoing 12/7/2020
-hacker can take your account if your account isn‚Äôt linked to phone and email

Minor 
-gambling addictions can be developed 
-a 5 star character is 100 bucks or more in other regions
-doesn‚Äôt give exact rates of 5 star chances
-everything is lock behind a energy system 
-resource are scarce

The most annoying problem is mostly the security since they make so much money from us in the hundred millions. They can‚Äôt even make their game secure enough so our account doesn‚Äôt get stolen.

Completely ridiculous and I think I will just have to not play the game until that time limit is removed because I cannot keep wasting all of my materials on one tiny level that should definitely not be as hard as it is. I went from having 20 lvl players to having to use up everything in my inventory for 40 lvl players for one small mission in a gigantic quest. How is that fair in any way???

11148,Expired Trash,"Genshin Impact is, in short, a fantasy, rpg (role-playing game), mmo (mass multiplayer online game), and a ftp/f2p (free to play) game. It came out this year on September 28. A lot of people had heard about it before the game was released and was really excited for it to finally come out. I found out about this game not long after it was released (October 3rd) and was super excited to give it a shot. Little did I know, this game was the start of a fixation or even something I was infatuated with. Or, to put it realistically, an obsession.

           Here is some more information about this rpg game. It's your basic fantasy game. There's monsters, magic, gods, and more. The game itself is high quality. For example, the graphics are impeccable, the views from atop mountains especially (when the sun is setting/rising or at night) are remarkable. The sound fxs are well done (including the soundtrack), and you can tell that they put a lot of detail into the game and they sure did get people's attention. If you even get close enough to the monsters you start to notice the insane detail that you‚Äôve probably never seen in a fantasy game before. Although I am not an expert with gaming (especially fantasy games) I'm impressed, to say the least. 

         Although I can not describe this in a short amount of words, it's such an amazing experience. I have so much fun with this game and you‚Äôll just have to trust me or find out for yourself. It‚Äôs free on mobile devices as well as PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, and Microsoft Windows. Although I think the game is better on Playstation 4 (which I play on) or Microsoft Windows, the game is fun on any device as long as you have the storage for it. Overall, this is such a fun game, and miHoYo (The company that created Genshin Impact) did a great job.

Cost 29.99$ to do a 10 pull which is expensive and chances are you won‚Äôt get what you want. The game initially lures you into thinking that they will be generous with primo gems for pulls but after you finish quests and find all the chests the primo gems dry up badly.

Updated Nov. 2020: As a Zelda fan I downloaded this game because there are similarities. I am an old school Zelda fan and this game has moved to top my list over Zelda. It is far more imaginative than any game I have ever played. You can choose to read the stories or not, you can play without understanding but there‚Äôs just so much work and love poured into this game that it would be a disservice to not learn it all. There are updates almost daily, new quests, puzzles, lore, monsters, bosses....

I spend money because I want the devs to have reason to keep going and it‚Äôs worth it. You can play without learning but it‚Äôs so much fun to learn. There is a guide for nearly everything. I wish we could sell items we collect but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker. I can‚Äôt wait for this to come out on switch but it‚Äôs built perfectly for iOS as is. It is hands down the best game I‚Äôve ever played.Music, the story the art, it is truly incredible. Honestly I can‚Äôt find one thing to list that‚Äôs negative.I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a free game. I‚Äôm guessing the incentive for developers in app purchases and I hope they are making a ton of money.

When I first got this game I was really exited and did all-nighters just to play it. I was really far into it and had a bunch of characters and really high levels on them. On one of the quests where I fought a strong rock golem thing, I finally killed it and got the stuff.. or so i thought. When I came back to the game a few minutes later, all of my progress for it was GONE! The only thing that stayed was the damage that my characters took (some were dead). 
Another problem that occurred was with changing my username. When I changed my username all of the data from the game deleted completely. I had to start off from nothing and re-download all of the data that I already had(which made my device have barely any storage).

11207,CrystalClawKittens,"When I heard my friends talking about this game, I decided to download it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much because it was a free game, but overall it was a fantastic experience. 

Due to playing on mobile, the introduction cutscene was incredibly laggy for me, super laggy to the point I had to search the cutscene up on youtube because it wasn‚Äôt working out for me. This happens with all of the cutscenes (not the ones where the NPCs chat, but the cutscenes like where Stormterror is present in Mondstadt and the MC is pulled into the tornado). Next, every time I try to pull up something (map, inventory, characters, wish, etc.) it always glitches me out of the game. It has become a habit where I pray that it doesn‚Äôt glitch me out because the loading screen is way too long. This also happens sometimes when I am about to engage in a conversation with a NPC. Third, please remove timed challenges. As you can tell, many have quit this game because of these timed challenges. As I am writing this, I am stuck on the lost book quest with the 30 second interval challenge. I do not wish to give up, I have high hopes for this game. Fourth, I suggest bringing back some old banners for beginners so they have a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù beginner‚Äôs roll when they wish for the first time. This leaves a great impression on new players and I strongly encourage it. 

Otherwise, the scenery is stunning, details are absolutely beautiful. Character designs are likable and the concept of the game is great. The lore has the right amount of theater. I do wish that there was a way to level up our adventure ranks faster than grinding and completing commissions. I‚Äôd also like an easier way to gain intertwined fates rather than buying them and purchasing them at Paimon‚Äôs bargains. I am a f2p player, so we have it hard. I also recommend a trading system. Trading characters, artifacts, weapons, primogems, mora, and etc. 

Update: It has been kicking me out more than usual. Every time I interact with an NPC or pull up screen (bag, party set up, world map) it kicks me out of the game. I would really consider that. 
A glitch I found?: During the Luhua Landscape quest, I was able to glitch inside the ruins while it was loading. Now, when I go to finish the quest, I am not able to complete the quest officially and receive my awards.",4,Playing it every day! But...,2020-11-12 20:23:39,False

11215,Sheabay01,I‚Äôm always hesitant to download games on my iPhone because I‚Äôm too scared that they‚Äôre going to be stupid or the trailer doesn‚Äôt fit the game. This was not the case for this particular game. I was shocked to hear that this game was coming to the Apple store and also on other game devices. This open world game is one of the most detailed games you could possibly have. The storyline is super amazing and really thought out.The gameplay is great and has endless possibilities when it comes to exploring and discovering new things. The only thing that I would say I wish the game had would be better crafting for weapons and objects and also to add customized outfits for each character. It would be really nice to be able to buy clothes. I would also say that I wish that the main character could be customizable as well to cater to POC.It would just be nice to have a character that looked a little like me. Not just a name. Other than the lack of customization there‚Äôs a lot of characters to choose from when it comes to gaining them overtime and a lot of different game plays for each character. 10/10!,5,One of the top games of all time.,2020-11-10 23:29:29,False

I am really lucky with this game bcoz I also got Qiqi for my second 5star character just in 30 or 40 wishes. I didn‚Äôt recharge any money to get Diluc but I bought monthly payment and a little gems. But when I bought 14.99$ more got nothing haha .. Whatever it‚Äôs really nice to play and I highly recommend this game for the one who really love anime and wanna feel like a main character in anime. The second thing I love abt this game is you can choose character voice to Japanese. It feels like perfect for me.  But there‚Äôs one thing I think producers could fix a thing that we can‚Äôt get a level when we get higher rank. It takes a week to a month to get one Level.

The character Design  is great and all but I think that you should be able to customize the character you start off with like a little hat or a new shirt something like that. Number 2. the stamina bar before Genshin impact I played Zelda breath of the wild and that game had a stamina bar too but it got annoying so I downloaded the mod that removes that and the game play was a whole lot better so can you please remove the stamina bar it gets annoying. Number 3. I think that you should be able to download mod but I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that oh and texture packs and stuff that would be cool. Number 4. Leveling up I know it‚Äôs easy but it barely dose anything my character is level 40 and he can barely do crap I grinded and looked every where to find the stuff to advance.number 5.I know I know this is getting to long but this is the last one ok wishing the little things you need to get to do the wishes are really hard to find and the little star things you can use to buy wishs takes a long time to grind to get enough to actually buy one wish please make it easier.

It‚Äôs a super exciting game where you canPlay around, interact with characters, battle and way more. but there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs confusing me. At the beginning of the game, you see the travellers backstory with their brother or sister (for me brother) getting taken along with the other travellers powers away by some wizard. But when we start the game the little elf helper Paimon has no intention of helping you find your brother. You go on different quest with Kaeya and Amber but I really wanted to hear the plot of the story with the brother because I wanted to find him. So how come(spoiler alert) I have to go on some random pirate quest that isn‚Äôt even relevant to the story and ends up being fake?? I want to figure out the real story with the brother not about some dumb quest that won‚Äôt matter later in the story and I want to be able to figure out where he is. Otherwise this is a really fun game I plan on playing it every day. And I will be posting some of my fanart for this game on my YouTube account called peachiiskies, so go check that out!

Also I see little dogs in Monstadt and I can‚Äôt help but want one of my own to follow me on adventures. 

It would be so nice to save for a place in the game and buying all sorts of houses in the different regions (I‚Äôm still only at the Anemo region). Exploring is definitely super fun.

11247,Anthony.k.E,"The game looks nice that I agree on. But the main problem with it is the aggressive micro transactions and monetization it pushes. It tries making it seem that you don‚Äôt have to spend money to progress an stay on an even field through out the game is a lie.

 At first it seem your strong or on even footing but as the game progresses the enemies scale at a much higher rate than you do. Not only that but to play story missions you have to meet a certain level. In other games they have systems like this but there isn‚Äôt a hudge gap between levels. You will finish a story mission at level 16 then the next one is 26. 10 levels doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot, but the amount of exp you gain is very small most missions only give you 100-250 rarely 500xp. And when it requires about 2000 xp to level up once early on, the game requires heavy grinding. The grinding doesn‚Äôt even that rewarding when you meet your goal. 

The only way to get characters is by using the games many forms of currency. There are only a few instances of where you can get characters you keep through quest. Most of the times there trial quest were get a feel and decide if you want to buy them or not. It‚Äôs a sad let down that characters that are heavily involved in the story are locked behind paywall called loot boxes. Yes you can get loot boxes from the wish mechanic but the guaranteed chances of getting a 4-star item is every ten if you bought them in one go. Then the promotional 5-star item/character is every 90 wishes. 

The game also feels a copy and paste of Zelda Breath of the Wild in a few ways. The glider you get acts the same way in that it consumes stamina. The enemies are just different models but the way they act is a one for one copy of BotW. 

My final thoughts on Genshin Impact are that is it‚Äôs an aggressive gatcha game that lures players with its free to play high quality graphics and good story to then using many forms of micro transactions and level gatekeeping to make the player grind or spend money to continue playing at an consistent paste. it‚Äôs a Zelda BotW re-skinned clone that uses many forms to slow the player down to want them to spend money.

11263,Jayson670,"First of, I love how Genshin Impact has the stylistic gameplay of Breath of the Wild. I love how when I first started, after doing several quests, opened the world map for me to explore. Gathering the Oculus, finding chests, defeating enemies, combos with elements, and basically trying to get the most out of the game. Not going to lie, I loved it from the beginning. But then now I‚Äôm AR 35 and I will say it‚Äôs a daily grind. Resin, resin, resin.... you miss out on one day of using up your resin, you miss out on the much needed EXP. I don‚Äôt mind the grinding nonstop on bosses or finding resources.... but come on Mihoyo. For a game that is what most might consider the Triple AAA of mobile gaming, you need to make your players stay. I get that it‚Äôs still new since release, but the resin and spending too much money is a burden. I will say I traveled all over Mondstadt and Liyue for chests and seelies, but that gives so little experience. The resin system, is such a low blow to this game, that even warframe (which I play) has better mechanics to address these. It‚Äôs an F2P game with a grinding system almost similar to Genshin but at least it gives you that value. Warframe for me became F2P but straight up because I love the game I spent thousands of dollars on it. Genshin, not even a month, I spent nearly a grand. Your wishing system also has really bad rates on wishing. I mean great for the pity system but really at 90. That means you‚Äôd have to buy the $29.99 at least 10x to hit the pity mark and most of the times it‚Äôs not even a five star character. That‚Äôs $300 down the drain. So being upset I tried it again and lord and behold another 5* weapon. Like really?!!!! Bye bye $600. I‚Äôve finally hit rock bottom with this game. Fix the wish system where it at least has a better pity, swap back and forth with characters and weapons instead of giving you something like what I mentioned, also characters with Max constellation should at least be addressed on the drops, because I frankly do not know what to do with a Max constellation character that appears on wishes constantly, and fix the resin system. Another game almost similar to this is coming out, despite this games success on launch you might lose a lot of players if that game comes out and does it better.

However, the Mihoyo team has recently nerfed any reroll by making one associate an account with an email (not username as in the past) while also decreasing the amount of free wishes. I have played multiple gacha games with low rates and completely understand how they need to make money. However, unlike other games such as Epic Seven and Dragalia Lost that provide either an easy reroll process or more generous rates, Genshin is 0.6% for a five star with the need to pull 7 copies to unlock all abilities. 

These types of games need to strike a balance between both groups and unlike other games in the realm, my personal opinion is the rates and further nerf of reroll are very punishing for any players who do not want to invest $100+ dollars into the game.

I just got it yesterday, and, oh boy, is this game beautiful. Upon starting I was just amazed at the open world aspect and how much free will the player had to roam whenever they please. How I could run into the ocean and swim as far as I wanted to even in the tutorial, which adds to the immersion. I hate it when games block off the ocean or this or that area. Also love the fact you can climb anywhere! Which is sort of unrealistic...to climb a flat, steep cliff like spider man, but also realistic in other circumstances like with trees. Nonetheless, instead of walking around through a set path and the mountain is blocked off, in this game, you can just climb the mountain if you have enough stamina and you can jump off with the glider. It just so much fun, not as repetitive, and adds a shortcut. Love how realistic and detailed everything is, how you can talk to most NPC, sometimes you get a little extra something too and each has their own personality. Haha, also strangely, you can‚Äôt hit NPCs but you can hit the NPC cat outside Diluc‚Äôs tavern and you launch it off the table it‚Äôs sitting on. Love that little funny detail.

THE BAD:

One thing that could be added is a better multiplayer support. I wanted to play this game with my friend, and I told him to download it so we could play together. Then, I read about how multiplayer works in the game and how limited it is. That just killed my friend‚Äôs interest in even trying it out. He finds one of the most important thing is to be able to make in-game friends/ play with your irl friends because it just makes it 100x more fun. Nonetheless, the NPCs are just so adorable and there‚Äôs so many NPCs scattered around the map that I rarely felt lonely. It felt like a lively city. Even if there‚Äôs not people, there‚Äôs animals and mobs all around. Also...it would be nice if the game is more realistic. You have to sleep or else you‚Äôll be tired. You have hunger and thirst. Since you have so much food to forage and there‚Äôs a lot of rivers, I think it would make use of the food u save up. Also it would be nice if we could build our own house and make it fully customizable. Where we can put on display our weapons and we can have a wardrobe and put a teleporter to home since a bag with like 30000 capacity is unrealistic and you feel free to collect everything in sight. I feel like this could be like a hard mode so people can choose if they want the challenge, but I personally think it would be fun. Although, the day/night cycle is pretty fast, so it would be annoying to eat/drink the normal amount. Maybe one meal required for full belly once a day? Also I would like pets! And if there are houses, maybe roommates of NPCs or my own friends when they are online. Maybe just make it an MMO and more PvP. I just see so much potential.

11317,Akirakun1,"My favorite game at the moment. I dropped 3 of my Honkai Impact 3rd games for the past 3 years for this. It‚Äôs REALLY fun, beautiful graphics & animation, fabulous orchestral music, very CUTE waifus & husbandos, excellent English Seiyuus and not as grindy at level 20. Character narratives are so funny. Transition loading times are a bit too long but perhaps it cannot be helped since it‚Äôs similar with other games. It appears free to play at the moment. I thought I signed up for beta but not notified. The reason for only a 3 star rating is because there is a serious overheating problem on my 8 month old iPad 6th gen which causes the game to randomly auto close after a few minutes. It helps a tad bit to play in front of a fan. I lowered my graphical settings to low but it heats up in less than a minute. Now it freezes but not autoclose. I‚Äôm on iOS 13.7. Would updating to iOS 14 help? I attempted to seek support but encountered some issues with the Mihoyo website. As a workaround, I play on android and my gaming desktop. No overheating, freezing or autoclosing. I‚Äôve recommended this game to a few of my friends however none of them can play it because of their devices are not top tier models. Playing this on 2k is so gorgeous.",3,Is Mihoyo listening?,2020-10-18 23:15:08,False

When in combat it‚Äôs difficult to dodge enemies and face them again. An enemy lock-in system would help here. Allowing the camera to float towards the direction the character is moving or facing would help as well. 

Movement suffers as well.the virtual joystick is a little too high and too far to the center to reach comfortably, especially in combat when you‚Äôre busy with other tasks and your hand moves. Moving the controller more towards the left corner would help a lot but allowing a floating controller to appear beneath your thumb wherever it lands near the corner would be best.

Character movement itself could also be smoother. Along with the camera changes noted above, allowing for a slower, mire controlled walking speed, and a slightly faster running speed, would make some tasks such as facing a chest or walking on windmill platform kedges a lot easier.",4,"Great game, needs work",2020-10-17 16:38:55,False

Playing through it was one of my favorite experiences. But eventually, you start to realize...you can no longer play. Everything you need to grind for is locked behind stamina. Every. Single. Thing. You realize that there is no way to level up anymore. The only adventure rank experience you get is from a few daily quests which take 10 mins to complete. 

You realize that the amount of currency you get needed to summon is laughable. You get 60 gems per day from those same daily missions you need to complete for AR experience. You get MAYBE 2 gems here and there from chests you find. So let‚Äôs say you get 80 per day. You need 160 to summon ONCE, which will probably be a weapon. But hey, at 10 pulls (20 days) you get a rarer item!....which is probably a weapon. Well, at least after 90 pulls (180 days!!) you can get a 5*!....which also will be a f***ing weapon.

Likes:
   The open world is amazing. I can never get enough of the sceneries and the side quests are so fun. All the characters are well developed and there are so many husbandos and waifus Wah! The story line is so good, I actually played this game for the story 100% no regrets. The game is pretty smooth and there really is no way to be bored in this game. Btw I am up to date with the story and am ar 30. I really like how the world advances with you, so I‚Äôm not fighting lvl 10 hilichurls. The events are fun and I enjoy the hidden things in the game.

Dislikes:
    There‚Äôs not much things I dislike in this game. But I‚Äôd start with resin. Resin makes a huge part of receiving rewards after bosses and such. I‚Äôm f2p, and I mean the amount of resin refills you get are pretty nice. But after leveling up you start to drain them quickly. And bosses are vital for ascending your characters. So quickly you can see what the problem is there...and then we have mora. Idk if it‚Äôs just me but my spending of mora is higher than my income. There‚Äôs a huge problem alr. I‚Äôm not buying unnecessary thing btw, I just level up and whatnot. But that‚Äôs all for now.

Suggestions:
Resin should refill more quickly
-Resin is vital and my resin doesn‚Äôt refill fast enough TwT
Primogems
-maybe make primogems more easy to obtain. I find it hard to save up for 90 summons. 
Co-op
-PLEASE MAKE CROSS SERVER CO-OP!!! I am in asian server but all my friends are in American. I can‚Äôt switch over nor play with them. Co-op is so fun but only if you have friends to play with.

Overall:
   100/100 recommend this game. The music is amazing, the entire world is beautiful. The story line is intriguing, the characters are fun to use, and there are so many things you can do. This does take a lot of space so I would recommend a more later model phone or device. I use an iPad, and there are no problems. This game is really amazing and I‚Äôm so grateful that I‚Äôm alive to witness this game. That‚Äôs all but my major request is cross server co-op :)",5,Close to perfection,2020-10-14 00:48:35,False

I‚Äôm not going to go into the details about it because there are so many videos on YouTube and responses on the internet that explain the issue. It needs a rework or needs to be removed entirely. Once more players reach the endgame this issue will be brought to the spotlight more. It feels like the game doesn‚Äôt want players actively playing anymore after they complete the current content. If this is not fixed it will drastically lower the number of people playing this game in the future.

1. Cross progression for the PS4 to all other platforms. Since PS4 owners can‚Äôt take their progress to other platforms it kinda makes PS4 owners disconnected. Plus since they can‚Äôt link their account they miss out on any redemption code specials going on.

The reason is that adventure mode literally felt like the legend of Zelda on the switch. The element mechanics simply amazed me because I am a big fan of elements that were featured in avatar:the last air bender.

The humongous world the game provides you is just gorgeous. I‚Äôve wasted a lot of hours just by exploring and doing side quests. I‚Äôve never expected to have this much of a fun by a mobile game. And trust me,I‚Äôve played a lot of AAA title mobile games.

However,I‚Äôll give it 4 stars because of 2 reasons: The first one is due to characters having an anime style look (personally not a fan of this but I definitely to understand why they made this choice). The other and the main reason is that the game has a loot box-ish mechanic called wishing. So you have to be lucky to get the characters/items you want. Thankfully,this effect doesn‚Äôt seem horrible at the moment because of the possibility of getting the items that are required to make a wish (unbox) for free and events that boost the chances of getting important things.

2-The dogs chases us around but we cant interact with them at all.Not even Atleast a belly rub.Please let us interact with the dogs.

3-The adventure levels are extremely hard to achieve after 17 levels.Its hard enough to find all of the experience but there is a low amount of quest and even QUESTS WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIFIC ADVENTURE LEVEL.Please make more quests or give more adventure experience each quest.

4-Please add more statue orbs because it‚Äôs a bit hard to find them not only for the lack of amount of orbs but also the amount of orbs you need to level them up.

5-The temples are cool but they need pretty high adventure levels and you already know what I mean by that from Three.

For perspective: In Genshin Impact you have a 1/333(0.3%) chance to pull a 5* character. In Dragalia Lost you have a 1/25(4%) chance to pull a 5*. In Arknights you have a 1/50(2%) chance of pulling the highest rarity, which is considered fairly low by industry standards. In Fate Grand Order, a much older Gacha known for its incredibly low and dated rates, you have a 1/100(1%) chance of pulling a 5*. A pity system is supposedly a failsafe. A system that prevents players who roll continuously from receiving nothing in return. Genshin Impact's base rates are significantly lower than the pity timer. This game is clearly set up so that the majority of players will only get a 5* character when hitting the pity timer.

11425,.Joey_Roo,"It took forever to load. During the opening cutscene freeze-framed so horribly I can‚Äôt even describe it. It also didn‚Äôt have any music or any narration like my two friends (who play on PlayStation and windows) when I got to the actual game still no volume or sound on ANYTHING. I was immediately met with a black screen except for a small patch of ground that I COULD see and my character was flashing a white orb thing (I have epilepsy so that is a huge problem for me, I had to get my cousin to tell me when it stopped, it stopped after 2 minutes) the fairy constantly went into the total black abyss so I had to depend on the mini map. I also was constantly glitching through rocks and the ground all the way up to half of my head and then I couldn‚Äôt move unless I was at the top of the ground. When I got the point of where I would defeat the first mobs (the red slimes) they would just repeatedly resepan and there was 0 instruction on what I do. I killed them 4 or 6 times and then they started glowing white and flashing (which again, is a problem for me and I had to get my cousin, they didn‚Äôt flash for long, only about 30 seconds) after that I turned away from them in game so I wouldn‚Äôt get a seizure...I looked up to see if there was a sky and there was yet another flashing white orb which I assume was probably the sun. I closed the reopened the app 5 times and nothing changed, each time I opened it it was the exact same as when I started, long loading time, my character glowing and flashing, no sound, the black abyss and small ground. The game looks beyond stunning and I‚Äôd say right at par with BOTW, it has so much opportunity and is so amazing on windows and PlayStation. To the developer if you see this, please fix this issue somehow as this is a major problem. It‚Äôs so horrible that I genuinely can‚Äôt play it and it‚Äôs a big disappointment. I play on an iPad, the game says that newer models of phones and tablets work better and my iPad is only 2 years old with a BUNCH of storage space.

I want to thank the developers and anyone else who played a part creating this masterpiece. This is the only phone game I‚Äôve been this crazy about and suggested to all my friends. A couple are bummed out because they have android and can‚Äôt play so if you guys could get it on the app store for androids you‚Äôd get way more downloads and make more money. You guys deserve an award for this honestly and the highest of respect. This game makes me forget about the mundane day to day life and I just get lost in it. I‚Äôll be on for hours and won‚Äôt even notice. The only suggestion I have honestly is adding a mic feature for multiplayer and making the multiplayer a bit better and maybe making it a bit easier to find ingredients and items.

From the music to the environment, the japanese voice actors, story, combat, and unique interactive element mixing, everything about its production is absolutely amazing and I would feel guilty playing this game for free. Anime BotW but free? YES PLEASE. 

I actually started my play-through on pc and was just absolutely shocked when I heard it was fully integrated on mobile, the controls are seamless and are maybe even better than on the pc counterpart.

I have been seeing a lot of reviews complaining about the low five star rates and how it is going to be pay to win. Let me just say now, for the experience they provide free players, complaining about low rates is the last of worries. You do not NEED a five star, there is no point in the main story where you will require one. Sure itd be NICE to have one but there is no excessive/tedious grinding that f2p players need to do in order to compensate (if you know what you are doing). This is not some mindless hack and slash, players who creatively fight and make builds, make full advantage of the artifact system, make full advantage of top tier four stars like fishchl/barbara/xiangling ect, WILL be better than any mindless whale. 

You do not need to spend money on this game to have a good time, the four stars that the game provides are more than enough and with primo gems left and right for f2p, there is a very high chance you will get a five star on your run anyways.

This game should cost at least $14.99 in the appstore, hands down. I encourage anyone who has the spare change to at least buy the monthly pack since it is worthwhile and balanced. Have a good day!",5,About the paywall...,2020-10-03 03:41:21,False

Gameplay: 5/5- the game is smooth and what looks like basic combat on the surface has a lot of depth do to elemental reactions.Elemental reactions really pulls the weight of this category in fighting.
Graphics: 4/5- looking at this from an overall perspective the game looks good for a console game, nothing amazing. But for a mobile game it has a unique charm and looks great on your phone
World/game map: 5/5- the map is large and has many events and things to explore.
Other activities: 4/5- there is a decent amount of things to do other than fighting. Like cooking or solving mystery‚Äôs.

11481,Alfatreze,"First of all, I‚Äôd like to say that the game so far is great, for sure heavily Zelda botw inspired, but not a bad thing, as it picks up the charm and familiarity but works on buildings world around it. I‚Äôm curious to get to see the story unfold and how the large maps comes alive, especially as time goes on. That said I did do this on my android phone with a snapdragon 865. On my iPad Pro 12,9 1st gen, I have the same reported problem as other users. I was trying to fiddle with the settings but I‚Äôm stuck on the dragon initial flying part, and stuck on it.
I really hope they solve this as it would be great to experience it on the larger iPad screen, as it sometimes is hard to play on the smaller phone screen. 
Controller support would also be great as I could cast it and play on the tv. Also while on it maybe add android tv support along with the controller as it would certainly be a great experience on my shield tv too.",3,"Great game, but spotty hardware support",2020-09-30 19:26:54,False

11494,Zell123t,"I can honestly say that this game has me hooked, and its free. I spend just as much time on my phone and iPad playing this game  as I do on my PS4 just playing anything.I have at least three hours of gameplay so far. Is this a BOTW ( Breath of The Wild) look alike? Yes, but a complete clone? I wouldn‚Äôt say that. It‚Äôs obvious that this game was inspired by BOTW but there are many things that they do differently to make it stand out. I‚Äôm not gonna give any spoilers so please continue reading.

Ok. Let me start by stating an issue that people may have with this game. This game has a sort of loot crate system. I know, I know but hear me out. While playing the story you will chances to obtain certain characters. Sometimes the game will will give you character upon completing a certain task so check events, mail, and notifications in the menu. It is very easy to get the in game currency to be able to put bet your odds on getting the characters you want, and check your daily logins. I hate loot crates as much as the next guy but you gotta remember that this is a free game. They don‚Äôt have that many other ways of making money except the store that allows you to my currency with real money. I can say for the past 2 days of playing that I have never once used real money for this and I don‚Äôt‚Äô think I‚Äôll ever need. I‚Äôll probably use real money just to show my support or if I really want something but I don‚Äôt see that happening to often.

The gameplay is amazing. Battling creatures feels so fun and fast paced especially with the dash mechanic. Like I said before I‚Äôm mostly playing on my iPhone and iPad but I do play on PS4 sometimes. It‚Äôs convenient to be able to take my phone out and grind for loot and characters. Sad thing is that you can‚Äôt connect your accounts with PlayStation but you can still play on the same servers as them, android, and PC players.

Probably one of the biggest differences in this game from BOTW is the fact that you can choose from multiple characters. This gives you a variety of different ways to play with your own squad of characters. Makes me super excited to play this with friends with my own high level characters to just to take on high level bosses. The map is huge for a mobile game. just like BOTW it really surprised me. While that‚Äôs a console this was on my phone and and requires only 8Gb of storage space. To play a game on this scale on devices like these is incredible. The colors really pop out at you so that‚Äôs something to really admire. There are plenty of enemies to fight and remember this game will have events that will keep you coming back to participate in. 

Like I said I‚Äôve only played a good near three hrs and I‚Äôm pretty sure I can say more but I‚Äôm goon and leave it that. I‚Äôll be posting videos of this game on YouTube. Channel name is DiversityPlay.",5,"Truly, truly, TRULY..... amazing!!!",2020-09-29 21:13:25,False

11501,javierdimla,"PROS: If you‚Äôre an adventure seeker and love exploring, this game would fit suitable for you. I literally randomly saw this game recently drop yesterday (9/28/20) whilst scrolling through my App Store and decided to give it a download. Upon finish, I must admit, I played this game the ENTIRE day yesterday and couldn‚Äôt put my phone down. It has that story that just draws you in wanting to know more, if you know what I mean. The graphics are breathtaking, fighting system easy to control and pleasing to see, weapon/artifact enhancement aspect, ability to interact with most things you explore, and so much more. It reminds me a lot like Zelda and Kingdom Hearts if y‚Äôall are in to that.

Suggestions: 

- Be sure to have enough storage space on your phone to play this game smoothly
- Try to have a good connection via WiFi unless you have the ‚Äúlatest‚Äù phone that supports 5G (you‚Äôre not doing this game justice if you don‚Äôt have good connection to play it - it‚Äôs pitiful to see someone play and it lags through cut scenes and fighting scenarios)
- I am hoping this game could offer more of a multiplayer that could allow more open world exploration that would enable cross-platform accessibility with real-time players around the world. Perhaps other game modes that could allow players to link together and compete for whatever incentive. PvP is the wave when it comes to gaming, let‚Äôs be real. It‚Äôd be so dope to run through your world of exploration and see other real-time players in your servers, like World of Warcraft. (Though this game is great, any competitive online gaming will always have the edge and more people playing it compared to these adventure games [Genshin Impact])
- I‚Äôm hoping for a Season Pass that players could purchase that would grant them with exclusive skins, weapons, items/materials, etc...
- I‚Äôm hoping for a bigger and expanded world to explore enabling for developers/creators to impose more mobility into the game.
- More AI‚Äôs and bosses to fight
- More interaction with the open world (i.e. being able to dive down in waters, picking up/throwing things, fishing, farming?

I have a lot more suggestions I could say, but the game just dropped yesterday and I really really REALLY hope you guys, app developers/creators, see this review and take it into consideration for the app‚Äôs next update. This game has SOOO much potential, let‚Äôs ride with it and keep the curiosity of exploring going.

11570,KayTheSmilie,"Hey. This game is great! I totally recommend it maybe for 10+(I‚Äôm 12). The only thing that gets on my nerves sometimes are the gacha rates. I would maybe increase the 5 star rate to 4% and make it so we are guaranteed to get a 5 star every 60 or 70 pulls.  90 is kinda overkill üòÇ. I understand that you guys want to make money, and that this humongous game is free, but people who don‚Äôt want to spend money or are just not patient enough will just end up being frustrated with the game and delete it. But everyone, I know that gacha rates are impossible and I know that it looks like a cash grab, but the game is free, rather than it out right costing 60 dollars. You still have a choice and to be patient. The one 4 star every 10 pulls is fine. I just hope Venti comes back! ü§ûüèª

Edit: For those struggling with the Wish system, patience pays off. Just keep investing primogems into either Wanderlust Invocation or the event banners, and it will pay off. I got Keqing out of luck on the Childe banner after so many 4 star weapons and trash characters, and am nearing 90 pulls for Childe as well. I regret investing into the regular banner for Diluc, and realized that the event banners are more worth it at least for me. You just gotta have the patience. If not, this game is not for you , I‚Äôm sorry.

Edit 2: also one more thing, sometimes if your internet connection isn‚Äôt very good, first you won‚Äôt be able to perform a certain action, like switching characters for example, then, in about 20 seconds(maybe shorter or longer), it will say ‚Äúreconnecting‚Äù and then take about 45-60 seconds to reload after that. My internet connection in my room isn‚Äôt very good anyways, but if anyone reads this then for best results, try to play in an area with good connection.

Edit 3: Warning! Don‚Äôt get Zhongli. Even though he looks cool, he‚Äôs absolute crap. Just wait till they buff him or see who is next, I‚Äôm waiting for Xiao :)",5,"I love this game, but I‚Äôm like everyone else",2020-12-11 13:08:44,False

Other than that I think that the game is very well coded and there is a lot of storyline to the game so you could play for endless hours and you would still have plenty more of the game to play so I highly recommend this game for anybody that wants an RPG game that will last and with a good storyline.

11607,AurouaBorealis,"Honestly, I love this game, but there are many flaws with this. I would‚Äôve given it a 5 star if not for these.
First off, the whale-friendly stuff. The newer characters are too much constellation dependent, and that‚Äôs a huge flaw. For example, Zhongli is basically broken with his constellation maxed out while underwhelming if you are a free-to-play player. Overall, most characters don‚Äôt have too many flaws, but the newer characters without their constellations are underwhelming and not very satisfying to play with.
Then there is the connection. Yes, sure I am playing on a phone, but it would be a lot better to experience the game without this much crashing. For example, while challenging the Oceanid, my game had lagged me out of the game, restarting all my progress (I was almost done). Another situation was with the Pyro flower, where it had less than 10% hp left and my game had suddenly crashed, leaving me with my Q and E attacks needing to be replenished. I have much experience with the lags, and I do not personally enjoy the game as much as I do with the lag.
I‚Äôve been playing since day one of release, and I‚Äôve been through many crashes, in instances where I nearly kill an opponent before my game crashes and I have to restart it all over again. And during that time, my hp is drained, to the point where I am about to die. During that point, if I teleport out I have to deal with more crashes, preventing me from teleporting to the designated area. It has been extremely frustrating to deal with, and I think the game should at least not have you re-enter in the middle of the battlefield when you crash.
The gacha system. Yes, it sounds horrible, but my most hated is the gacha system. It‚Äôs very expensive, with 160 primogems, and can take hours to gather if you are collecting off of chests alone. Including that, the pull rates are extremely low, to the point where it‚Äôs futile to go much further. But I do like that they improvised with the system and created the carry-on pity system. 
Drop rate of anything and everything. Certain items can only be dropped by monsters at a certain level, but it is not guaranteed to even drop. Most of the time, you will get the lowest level, and frequently 1 or 2 even with the world level increasing. Once, I had challenged Midsummer Courtyard, an area to challenge for weapon ascension materials. I had used condensed resin on the second to last hardest rank, and using origin resin after beating the domain, it did not give me even one of the drops. It was not a Sunday, in fact it was a specific allotted day. Yet I had only received a small portion. It is disappointing to see that many times.
Broken characters. Just like how some characters are underwhelming and not very useful, there are also broken characters. The main one is Diluc. He is a claymore user and a pyro element, categorizing in both of the more favored sections of characters. Everything for him is flat attack, even at a low level. When I had gotten him, I was able to level him to level 40, with a level 40 weapon, and he had managed to overpower my two support DPS and tank, and with the potential to overpower my main DPS. All three of them are level 70, and one is over that. Meanwhile, Diluc who is level 40 could show enough power to beat my sub DPS and my tank/support. I have zero doubt he can overpower my main DPS. 
Favoritism. Spear users are not very good, and there are significantly less characters in the spear category. The claymore users are all in high attack, and the catalyst users all have decent attacks higher than both sword users and bow users. 
I don‚Äôt suggest you play the game unless you have extreme patience or are willing to spend a dime on this. 
But a lot of stuff is beautiful, these problems counter what I like about the game.",1,It‚Äôs good but has many flaws,2020-12-10 18:28:30,False

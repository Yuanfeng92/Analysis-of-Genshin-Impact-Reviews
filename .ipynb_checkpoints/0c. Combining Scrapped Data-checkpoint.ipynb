The controls can be cumbersome causing you to move or act in a way that could cause you to do something you dont mean to. 3. Sometimes the game lags during cutscene. I am using a galaxy S8 with plenty of ram while connected to wifi. So it could be a server issue. Other than that it is an awesome game I will keep playing\n",

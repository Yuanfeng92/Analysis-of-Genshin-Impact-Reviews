Cuz the probability of the characters are ridiculously low and i haven't been getting any 5 star characters on that banner and instead i got 5 star weapons. It'd be great if you do that!

No complaints besides (not even a complaint) that when I turn to a certain angle when the character is up against a rock or a wall, I can see eternal damnation and their demons (inside the character) and it scares me. It's nothing. I'm just really jumpy. But amazing game! Amazing content. Keep doing what you're doing and come out with this game on the switch soon!\n",

This game is just so good and also it is kind of hard to get more characters because of how much hard it is to collect primogems but I don't mind it since the new event gave me two five stars and also genshin impact is trying to make this game better and it keeps getting better and better :)\n",

      "No 7. There's so much to say about the reason why I love this game! BUT the only issue I have is that I have two accounts now and would like to delete one so I can link my email to the account I want to use. That's why I hope there will be a possibility in the future that we can delete our accounts on our own as fast as possible or maybe another way to solve this.\n",

      "No 1. I am a YouTuber, KevGuuey, and I have been enjoying the game as a F2P player since around global public launch. The thing is if you are going down this road, you need to be efficient and conservative on materials, mora, artifacts and weapon upgrades, which party members are worth the leveling up for 2 teams for the Abyss, and especially using primogems on what is important. Other than these downsides, the game is quite enjoyable but I hope they actually do something to make co-op more fun.\n",
      "No 2. Great but it be better for the game to have a strengthen account security as well as stop putting all strength of 5 star characters in constellation. Also please strengthen the geo characters or have an elemental reaction as well as improve the animation like honakai hahahaha Overall great experience except the above\n",
      "No 3. Graphics is like that of Pokemon Sword and Shield. Gameplay is like of Dragon Nest though instead of focusing on one Character you'll have to focus on 4 Characters as a party.

      "No 4. This game is Semi-mmo. It is not full mmo just thought many people get confused about it and thought it was full mmo. Anyway, this game raised the bar to mobile gaming platform so high that playing other open world games seemed pale in comparison.\n",
      "No 5. Its a great game and i have a suggestion. Why don't make a trading system so player can trade items they did not use but other player use. And i think this is neccesary because lots of people have materials they dont need but others player need and the other way too.\n",
      "No 6. They should add an option to message friend to join his world, because low level player cannot join high level player, so if he need some help, he message an player in his friends list and his friend joins.\n",
      "No 7. The camera zooms in by itself some times, the stamina system needs improving and the gacha rates could be a bit better for the F2P players. Everything else is top tier, graphics, world, characters, voice acting and combat are all fantastic.\n",

      "No 1. Used to think this was the best gacha I'ver ever played until impotent Zhongli was released. Along with the other weak Liyue 5-star characters and this whole Liyue \"B***F*\" drama blew up everywhere. I thought Mihoyo was a Chinese company trying to singlehandedly export some Chinese culture but instead they keep telling us how great Mondstadt is and how weak and obsolete Liyue is in comparison. The gacha rate is ridiculously expensive already and you give us a 3-star Zhongli disguised as 5-star?\n",
      "No 2. MHY releases hype trailers and blatantly misleading live streams to sell underwhelming high-rarity characters (worse than lower rarity characters in almost all fronts) and then has the gall to ignore player feedback and condescend to them saying essentially \"[Zhongli] is working as intended, please learn how to build him properly.\" For a pve game, increasing underperforming characters' power to be on par with others of similar rarity hurts no one, but MHY is too prideful and greedy for that.\n",
      "No 3. Monetization is ruining this game. I don't mind spending money, but I want to respected as a player, not a walking wallet. Progress is heavily gated behind stamina. Important parts of 5 star chars are gated behind paywalls heavily. This is really evident with the new 5 star, who without his kit can hardly compete with 4 star chars. You maybe need to spend thousands to make this 5 star char complete. If the game continues to go in this direction, I cannot see a bright future.\n",
      "No 4. Zhongli Recently released 5 star character was released under-tuned, and as a result, underpowered. Even as a support, he pales in comparison to lower rarity characters. Mihoyo holds much of Zhongli’s power behind constellations that require multiple dupes (AKA hundreds to thousands of dollars). Disappointed. This is an excellent game, but if 5 star characters continue to be poorly designed and their true power gated behind severe pay walls, I won’t be playing much longer.\n",
      "No 5. 5 star heroes never easy or cheap to own. Zhongli is the new 5 star hero they released and his so called \"support\" unit (they never said when advertised), but his potential are being locked in the constellation. Which means we will never get a full potential hero unless you whale (A LOT). This behaviour is become a trend for MHY, which means we may only get a 30% potential of a 5 star hero in the future if we just roll a single unit for it. Rating it 3 star for now because of their greedy.\n",
      "No 6. Don't waste your money for this game, not recommended for people with addiction problem. the gatcha droprates is horrible, game progression gated with paywall. Even to level up your character's talent is gated with weekly bos item that u might found at about 2 years grinding. And Zhongli is bad for 5* char worth about 200 usd! Mihoyo you are a greedy predator in this industry. Check reddit and their forums first! See how much people complain and Mihoyo not even bat an eye\n",
      "No 7. Best single player experience atleast. Gacha part of this game is bad since you must rely on some constellation levels, its even worse for Zhongli because of locked behind paywall support. This is the first gacha game I played where characters are gone until they do another event summon, so goodbye Venti/Klee/Childe and new 4stars. The resin system has been raised by only 40 more. Battle pass on top of this extreme gacha? Pushing it. $100 = 50 rolls a big no. Buff Zhongli\n",

      "No 1. They actually have a Chinese Communist Party PR shill trying to mislead people on Reddit on how \"good\" the state of the game is currently at. The company is also secretly sending gems to streamers to influence people in spending more money in the game, bypassing the promotion label law due to secrecy & non currency exchange. Why is the company acting so suspicious? Hiring CCP as shills should be a red flag due to CCP influence & spyware.\n",
      "No 2. Edit: There are so many people saying they got hacked and received ridiculous response from your CS saying they cannot recover the account because the hacker purchase new stuffs. I am scared that I will lose my account and considering to not purchase anymore. Please fix the security and the account recovery rules.\n",
      "No 3. We are using google login (google play game) to play the game and there is no option to redeem any code since the official website doesnt provide option for google login its UNFAIR. If use our google email to login or register to the website it will create a new game account.\n",
      "No 4. My account got hacked then when I contacted support to reclaim my account, I can provide all information about my account except one single purchase bill (give all other bills) and Mihoyo support said no. I'm very dissappointed with how Mihoyo support players problems!\n",
      "No 5. Decent game but lacks basic security features like two factor authentication. People getting hacked and/or notifications about others trying to hack them left and right. Will consider changing rating when basic security features are added.\n",
      "No 6. Hello mihoyo, i hope you can help me fix the issue i encountered, i'm trying to purchase the gnosis hymm, but i encounterer a problem with my google play, and then after i tried to process another transaction it says \" failed to get product information\" hope you can help me.\n",
      "No 7. I previously posted a review that magically vanished overnight (no notification). This game is a lottery in more way than one! If you Google \"genshin impact account error\" you'll see what I mean. Overall the game itself is good, but it's just too unstable and you may wake up one day with your account locked out and no support.\n",

      "No 1. Can't finish the data resources so waste of time. I already at 4GB away to reach 7GB data resource. I left to the game because it says it will continue to download in background, so it does. The real thing is it vanished in my notifications l bar then when I open the app it restarts the download but when I look in the application manager it stores about 4GB why???? I have 10GB free storage and it said insufficient because the download data resource restarted. What a waste. Can you fix this ???\n",
      "No 2. This bug is starting to annoy me..sometimes when using pyro(fire) attack, a random environmental electro effect triggers, then it get me blown off and fell down, no wonder I kept getting blown off whenever I use fire skill sometimes while battling enemies. It happens even not in battle, example when I use Klee I throw a bomb and I saw purple Electro effect the moment the bomb explodes sometimes.\n",
      "No 3. Please make it run fine for all kinds of phones. I am using realme 5 with 128gb storage ang 1/4 of my phone storage is in use and the game still lags, crash and my phone is over heating. The longest time I played the game is 28mins and it crashes all the time. Please fix it. I really love the game and it's a fun game. As of december 5,2020 9:19pm PH time. My phone hangs longer yhan before twice today because of over heating. Take note, I only played the game for 15mins. Please do something.\n",
      "No 4. since the last update i got to play it in my mobile phone though there are still bugs and laggy moments especially in water battle areas and it makes it difficult to finish a quest because of its laggy-ness some of their skills doesn't come out or they may act like doing it but it doesn't come out also when I attack slimes in waters I slide out too far— as in SLIDE not walk or run while Im frozen in act of attacking the battles in water are just laggy af :) pls fix this\n",
      "No 5. This game is poorly optimized which makes the game unplayable. The game stutters each time it is streaming and loading assets in the background. Even on a Mi 10 rooted for performance phone equipped with a Snapdragon 865 chipset this game runs poorly. The 30 FPS mode is not correctly frame paced and is not smooth. The developer needs to reduce the draw distance and run the game with the Vulkun API. And fix the 30 FPS mode so it looks smooth.\n",
      "No 6. The game looks amazing, but its unplayable for all but extreme high-end phones. I have a medium-end phone (Blackview BV9100) and its a stuttering, unplayable experience even when all settings are turned down as low as they can go. Also, both times ive installed the game ive had weird texture glitches. The first time the ground didnt show, and the second time the thing that flies through the sky in the beginning didn't show properly.\n",
      "No 7. The game is good and the story line is nice but how come Everytime I face Dvalin the screen just glitches? My phone is Infinix HOT 9 play and it was a bit compatible at first but when I faced Dvalin, it just glitches not to mention Everytime I fight in a nearby lake, river, ocean, the game just lags and gets delayed. The timer on the challenge still goes normally but the cool down of my skills are really delayed despite my internet connection being stable. Right now, I'm having troublewithcutsce\n",

      "No 1. Good game but monetization is getting out of hand. The recent update introduces a 5star character kit locked behind a constellation 6. (if u have no idea of what constellation is, it is basically getting another duplicate of that hero, and 6 is how many dupes u need). Based on the current trend, if no changes are in place, future heros might see even more obvious kits being locked behind paywall. Please do not start this game if u hv no discipline on your wallet.\n",
      "No 2. The story of the game is very good. I usually play this game like 1~2 hours a day. It's your choice to grind hard or play casually. However, there's an issue with the recent release of character. Zhongli (5*), the God of Geo who is supposed to be a \"support\" character is being outshined of 4* characters. His core abilities are being locked behind a paywall, and it is affecting the community greatly. I'm afraid this trend will continue and the company will release these kind of characters.\n",
      "No 3. Everything was bad, unbalanced heroes drop rate, to many bugs. The game is made for pay to win to progress. If you guys are f2p, dont instal it im telling you guys. This game is pure luck for f2p. Dont waste your time playing these. I can't believe this game have 4.5 rating i believe the rating was fake. Well after doing almost 100 wish still I don't get any 5 star character, this game was trash, dont ever play this..... Its pure luck game!!!!!!!\n",
      "No 4. It makes me really sad I love the idea of this game but no matter how hard I try I never pull a character, I don’t think it’s fair to make us spend so much money to ~ maybe ~ get a 5 star (or even 4 star) I just wanna have the same opportunities that gamers with a lot of money have, because they can roll however many times they want.\n",
      "No 5. Still waiting for 2 Factor Authentication to be implemented. Genesis Crystals cost way too much. Zhongli's kit needs a fix/buff as he's only half functional and can't even do his job properly as a support (seriously?). A part of me wishes I could trade him in for 4* dupes. Resin takes too long to recover. Guess I'll revert to f2p from now on.\n",
      "No 6. Can’t believe you make ZhongLi so weak!! He is the first character I love so much in a game, the first game ever I spent $300 USD for him, it's not about money but the feelings that someone you loved so much being called rubbish or the worst 5 Star even a 4 stars is better than him!! -5 Stars until he get what's he deserves!!\n",
      "No 7. Game is great and everything is wonderful, until you spend some time on this game then you understand the limits they put on f2p players, then you really start to hate the game, because to get 5 stars weapons or characters you need to spend alot of money and its not worth because you will never get the characters of weapons that you actually want .\n",

      "No 1. Controls are broken on large tablets. I get it doesn't have controller support but it also doesn't let u adjust the touch controls. It uses a fixed joystick for moving instead of drawing the joystick wherever u first touch the screen. What's worse is the positioning clearly wasn't set up for large tablets. Instead of being on the far left side of the screen it's closer to the center. The only way to move is to use your pointer finger as its unreachable with ur thumb. Really disappointed smh.\n",
      "No 2. Too many security issues that allow hackers to take control of your account despite linked email or phone number. Takes forever to respond on customer service. Also, if you don't contact them every two days or so when they say your ticket is in the queue, the ticket will be closed for inaction, starting the process over again. Until I get my account back and these security issues are fixed, I stand by this rating since it is pointless how much you like the game when you can lose your account so easily due to Mihoyo's security issues\n",
      "No 3. Account was hacked due to their poor security, takes long time to get help, customer service is a gach, like in the game, you either get lucky or unlucky and wait days or week for response/resolution from what others with hacked accounts hace experienced (myself included). Some wait days for resolution while others take weeks to a month. CS also is inconsistent some say something, others say something else. Until it changes rating will remain unchanged.\n",
      "No 4. Fun while it lasted. But then one night I get a message, Logged on another device. Changed passwords made a ticket but you banned me for what the hacker did to my account, its been over a week no response its bs and I want it fixed and thensome or refund all purchases. The hackers stole logon information directly from your website you're at fault there are write ups on the exploit you supposedly fixed that let people use login tokens but you didnt reset affected accounts ?\n",
      "No 5. The game is really good and fun to play! But there is a massive problem. There are way to many people saying their accounts are getting hacked. The numbers of complaints are concerning. Even tho the game is great, people might as well just stop playing so they have less of a risk to getting hacked.\n",

And the percent chances of even getting a character are so low, I've wished so many times, saved up so much and only to be met with a thrashy 3 star weapon. Please change the chance rate for a character, it gets old very fast.\n",
      "No 4. I would like to give 5 star but after playing for 2 months I noticed that the primogem income is to low for f2p player. I think it needs a rework. I prefer honkai impact style of earning crystal. If the current system continues f2p player will have a hard time getting 5 character or weapons (I am taking about a single copy not a full constalation). And will ultimately prevent them from playing as there is nothing to look forward to in future Or introduce farmable character to keep them playing\n",
      "No 5. Im rating this a 3 because the exploration is good, The battles are good, The story is good, quests are good, but the rates of getting new characters is so bad and you have to grind for hours just to get to 1600 primogems it is so hard to get new characters if your a F2P player i cant even get the 4 star character i want because of the rates and because i cant get new characters, the battles are getting boring i litterally have the same team from AR 20 to AR 30.\n",
      "No 6. Guys seriously? I gave it 5 star review before . since I started the game I have been saving for a 5 star character. Till today I have been daily loging in and grinding for gems . Like at my 85 summon I got a 5 star weapon . If I want a 5 star weapon I would roll in a weapon banner , why would you give me a weapon on a character banner. I worked really hard for getting a single 5 star item but it wasn't a character but a weapon . Plz do something about it . Its really hard for F2P players 😪\n",
      "No 7. Have fun If you like those games that it's harder to freaking pass their freaking quests because there's impossible things like the glider test pass the glider test That's a test God it's the hardest thing I've come across so far in this game it's almost impossible I've done it almost 20 freaking time so far and found out that it is never going to happen you can't stay afloat you can't fly it's almost past a gliding test but you got to be able to fly to pass it\n",

      "No 1. The game is fun, but everything is designed to try and make you pay for something. The worst being the battle pass. You have to buy the premium battle pass every month. There is no f2p option to get the premium battlepass after buying it once. Talent book and weapon ascension domain have poor drop rates for the higher tier resources its extremely deflating doing the hardest level and not getting a 5 resource of even enough of the lower resources to craft a 5 star resource\n",
      "No 2. This game has wonderful graphics and game play, only thing is that this is a mihoyo game...and they want money. Basically 50% of the game is blocked behind a paywall and you need to spend lots and lots of money to progress at a normal pace and not a slow one like every normal player does. The character rates are horrible and you need resin (Basically in-game energy) to get items to get more stronger. So with that said, you'll have a much better time playing Azur Lane a Yostar game.\n",
      "No 3. Genshin Impact is really amazing game with a lot of bad mechanics. The story and the world the game is set in is huge, interactive, and dense with puzzles and stuff to explore. For the first 30-35 levels, there's so much to do that you'll spend hours exploring every book and cranny of the game. However, the game's end game and mid game are a gated slog that drags down everything else that makes this game so amazing Literally everything in the game is gated behind resin and it isn't fun\n",
      "No 4. Beatiful game with abyssmal gacha rates. While one may argue that the rates are like so due to a thin roster of available heroes currently, you still do need multiples of a character to max them out so providing better rates should still make the game financiallly viable. While I do like to spend on gacha games every now and then just to support the company, I will never spend on this game due to the gacha rates\n",
      "No 5. Horrible Experience I didn't pull out the card in my wallet just to get 30 weapons. At least fix your gacha and ensure there is at least 1 chara for every 10 pull like I just want Xinyan. It's a 4 star character but still can't get it because of what. Because all you give is weapon, weapon, weapon, weapon.\n",
      "No 6. With how bad the gacha rates are and how expensive it is to gamble in this game, it makes no sense that there is no way to fodder the constellations you get that you do not want. You pretty much get nothing if u are not lucky enough to get what you want. Even if you spend alot.\n",

Controls could be smoother, and characters could definitely be a little more balanced, but my biggest gripe, and only reason I took stars off, is my daughter really enjoys this game, but has a hard time on some missions, but I can't co-op with her for missions because apparently having that option would be detrimental somehow to the people who don't want to use it.

Downloading speed here in PH is like a turtle -_-. Maybe you can try to minimize just a little bit the DL resources for the new update. Downloading resources sucks always error!!!\n",

I like the game and I truly want to get into it, but from what I've read about the recent update and from what I have experienced, the lag is unbearably high to the point where it becomes completely unplayable. I tried closing the app and opening it back up, bit it just doesn't work. It heats up my phone and ruins my wifi, so until there's a patch or something, I don't think I'll be able to play this.

Instead downloading real big chunk of data (14giga) on pc, its downloading useless update data (12giga) And have to dowload another 14GIGA I really dont know that uninstaling is an option until now. it is a really good game thank you. I suggest to use partial than huge data instead on pc user\n",

However today this game updated to 160mb and disappointing fact is that as I open it up, It showed as 5GB update as a whole and all in all it show in my phone as 10GB app. It exceeds my other apps for this single game. I know this is crazy and disappointing as well.\n",
      "No 7. It asked me to update and then when I did it all over again is downloading 5.6GB of gamedata which is so stupid. Please fix this problem. Not everyone can download 5.6Gb again and again after every update. This is so disappointing because now I just have to stop playing because I ain't wasting my internet again just because of an update. This is the same problem PUBG had when they first launched on PlayStore as well...\n",

      "No 1. Good game with mainly 1 big problem, the gacha rates. To get a \"guaranteed\" 5* character you need to pull an equivalent of 100$ of gems, which will give you enough gems to get the pity timer at 90 pulls. If you wanna try your luck with the 0.6% rate for 5 stars be my guest. Worst rate in all gacha games I played.\n",
      "No 2. Why are you reading this when you could be playing this masterpiece? OH... right. Because of the 2 notorious issues that keep this game from being 5-stars... 1. Just be aware that this is a gacha game w/ 1% hits on banner draws. Sadge 2. More notorious is the endgame. It will essentially limit collections of all significant rewards to 3-6 per day. So play with patience, or play with your wallet to earn more Resin.\n",
      "No 3. Its pretty good all in all But for free to play players its pretty hard.. U neet to grind so much for primogems to get a hero or an item. Which means it will be harder to get a 5 star hero or item.... Constellation is pretty hard to upgrade... Also refinements.\n",
      "No 4. This has some very rich game play and characters, though once you hit AR40, expect to be very disappointed with the exceptionally long and/or expensive grind to get your characters upgraded enough to survive again. The balance and resin systems need a major overhaul as well.\n",
      "No 5. would make it a 5 star but the gacha system is pretty bad especially for f2p who only use primogems for wishes, we f2p barely get anymore when you're ar 30+ i wish there could've been a free wish everyday just like other gacha games do\n",
      "No 6. Everything is good, but the dropped exp should increase with every level because at a high level, dropped exp does basically nothing. For those who want everything at the beginning of the game, you do get a starter bonus that actually helps.\n",

To get a \"guaranteed\" 5* character you need to pull an equivalent of 100$ of gems, which will give you enough gems to get the pity timer at 90 pulls. If you wanna try your luck with the 0.6% rate for 5 stars be my guest. Worst rate in all gacha games I played.\n",

Rating arent permanent, going to change this if the bug is fixed.\n",

The camera, The camera does not let me see when I do the dash, it does not let me see when I am fighting an enemy, it stands in the trees or bushes that are nearby and I do not see anything, also at the moment of zooming it resets when walking, fix that and the best android game is decided. Also in Honkai Impact they had a very bad camera, they are good at models but remember, that's not all.\n",

They cover up the crown and make it hard to see what's going on and there's no way I can remember where on my smooth glass I'm supposed to touch for things. Really really need controller support.\n",

NOT WORKING HELP ;-; i have a iphone 7+ iOS version 14.0.1(18A393) and i know this game works on an iphone 7+ cause i’ve seen gameplay but for some reason it just does not work. before launch i was able to get to the start screen and pre download but now it doesn’t even launch and i’ve been waiting for a fix or something and it’s still broken. i even tried it on my friends ipad (not sure what build but i know it’s better than a 7+) and it does the exact same thing :(\n",

Like what I see was water but it was land that i could run on it. And my phone has a really decent spec tho. I tried the lowest to the highes graphic that didn't fix the glitces idk why. Gonna give more star if u can solve my problem. And for u guys wanna download the game, please go ahead. It's really a nice game tho.\n",

      "No 1. Most of upgrade material need resin to gather it while resin recovery speed took 8mins/resin. Resin recovery item is only fragile resin from adv rank reward n the other is primogems with low ratio that is 50gem : 60 resin while every upgrade material took around 20-60 resin per challange. That's not fun anymore when world rank up speed faster then character upgrade (i.e : talent up , weapon enhance , chara exp , artifact enhance) n no other thing to do because already cleared all quest n puzzle.\n",
      "No 2. Gems are very expensive and very rare, Events are not rewarding, Characters are locked behind premium currency, Daily log in system does not exist( it is a limited time event), Stamina/resin system is terrible and limits gameplay to 10-20 min. And after 1 month of feedback - everything was ignored, Late game content does not exist and daily tasks becomes worthless as chests drop nothing good, Co op is rarely fun and this game is more of a single player game. Comes from a lvl 38 player who has the first limited character and used over 150 gacha pulls.\n",
      "No 3. Like others said, unfinished game, high cost gatcha, then pay more for stamina to play, weapon upgrade stone is limited by dailies like max 22? WTH. After AR 35, your vast world become empty box mihoyo, only few types of monter getting boring and you want to sell your primo? Haha fix it before your game goes down the toilet. Better add more worlds to explore, monster types and story before try to sell of new characters, no one wants new character to run same old boring empty box.\n",
      "No 4. Great open world game. Had a lot of fun exploring. However, the gacha rates in this game are disgustingly bad. The game offers a guaranteed 5 star every 90 pulls. Each pull costs 160 primogems, so 90 pulls would cost 14,400 gems. The amount of gems you get is stupidly low even on events. 100 per day for Klee event right now. Which I'm pretty sure only runs for 5 days. The gacha system even mixes the characters and weapons which makes no sense. At least separate the weapons and characters.\n",
      "No 5. i changed my mind, the drop rate for special heroes is super low, latest event state 50%drop rate for klee, but i only able to get repeated Sucrose after many time gacha. for normal gacha, i can only get repeated heroes which i never used, been gacha alot, get some 3-star weapon which i already refine +5 and the extra only can become food, a 4star weapon is useless if you dont get the same to refine. please fix the gacha, else you will losed a lot of player soon.\n",
      "No 6. Jesus christ the monetization and energy system are extremely bad. It would take 22 days of natural energy regeneration to get a character to max, and you use 8 of them for the end game content. That's not including the energy you'd then need to spend farming for equipment which is random. Rates on pulling units is abysmal at 0.6%, and your dailies accumulate 50/ 160 of the currency needed to pull per day, with a pity for a 5 star unit at 90 pulls so once you clear all the content get screwed\n",
      "No 7. Game is honestly probably the best mobile game ever made, until you reach AR35. The story ends pretty abruptly. Once you've explored the world, completed the quests, and found most the hidden stuff you're completely tied to the resin system. It takes a full 16 hours to get 120 resin, and you can literally burn all of it in less than 15 minutes of playtime. The gacha rates are also trash. It's all incredibly greedy. You can spend hundreds to play how you want, or be f2p and be super limited.\n",

      "No 3. Crashes to much. It’s really a great game but if I’m going to be honest, there should be a way for people with lower end PCs or iPhones to play this game. For example, despite being on the lowest graphics so the game won’t fry my graphics card, It still crashes. It’s the same thing for old phones. I get that the graphics in this game are essential and really important but all in all I want to play the game without worrying about crashing every 20\n",

      "No 7. I can play it fine on my phone, but for some reason I can't do so on my laptop. I've checked and I fulfill all the graphics requirements, and I'm able to launch the game just fine. The problem is, once I'm actually in the game, I have zero visibility. There's just blinding white light everywhere. I've reloaded the game a few times and it alternates between the blinding white light and a rainbow spectrum around everything. Could someone help me figure out how to fix this?\n",

      "No 1. Great open world game. Had a lot of fun exploring. However, the gacha rates in this game are disgustingly bad. The game offers a guaranteed 5 star every 90 pulls. Each pull costs 160 primogems, so 90 pulls would cost 14,400 gems. The amount of gems you get is stupidly low even on events. 100 per day for Klee event right now. Which I'm pretty sure only runs for 5 days. The gacha system even mixes the characters and weapons which makes no sense. At least separate the weapons and characters.\n",
      "No 2. Rating it this much is all I can give. Why? 1. Gacha system - pretty much horrible. You get to pull a guaranteed 5* after 90 pulls. Pretty much the pity system. With 4* in between 10 pulls. Which are very much... Mehh. 2. Resins - though it is pretty much okay cause you need to strategize on what to focus on. I find it bad cause if I needed this much materials for this one character, after increasing the level, it's like double. So yeah. Prettt much you just need to focus on 1 or maybe 2 of it\n",
      "No 3. Gatcha system is too expensive. Also, I lost intrrest because I never get the characters that I want. I spent already tons of time playing and wasting all my primogems and I still get pure junk. I also olay it in ps4 and the same thing. If there was a better chance to get the characters I want (Diluc, for example) I would even spend more money to guarantee him, but no, 200 wishes and I got only junk. I'm done.\n",
      "No 4. 5 stars gameplay. -5 star shop. The graphics and gameplay are fantastic, if you play this and never spend any money it's great. You can be very lucky with your purchases and be happy, but the rates are so low at times. It cost 30 dollars for enough gems for a ten wish and there is a strong chance you end up with nothing useful. Overall the game is 5 star, but if you spend money on it you are taking a huge risk based on price/reward\n",
      "No 5. I would rather pay once for the game and grinding my way through the game like the good ol' days. I understand this is a way for Mihoyo to make money, but gacha rate is stupidly ridiculous. In short, unless you are willing to spend at least few hunders usd per month, you are going to spend years to actually be good in this game. But I'll give 2 stars for the great times I had. You had me in the first half, not gonna lie\n",
      "No 6. Admittedly the game is really beautiful and well made, though the gacha system is quite ridiculous, you rarely get 5 star characters or even none, and hard to get summoning materials, and I just wished characters don't have Rarity stars in them or at least make all of them equally 5 star on rarity, so that no can be considered lame or weak in terms of rarity...\n",
      "No 7. Can't really give more than 3 stars to a gotcha game. For f2p, it's great. But the fact that it is literally impossible to get the banner heros even with a pity pull. Is really disheartening. I put 90 pulls into klee only to get a different 5 star, that in comparison, is trash. Not buying into this game. I have been rewarded better in other gotcha games that I have spent money on.\n",

      "No 1. Hello. Regarding the linking accounts especially Google, there seems to be quite a problem on this matter since when you use google account to play the game, it is possible (literally the google symbol next to facebook and twitter). But when you try to link your google account to Mihoyo, it can't seem to detect the google account—it says \"email not yet registered\". When I go back to the game, it's still there, unscathed. Moreover, google acc does not exist on other platforms. Please fix this.\n",
      "No 2. The game is actually great, the story is amazing. It just lacks content and the quests aren't too rewarding in terms of adventure rank experience by ar 18+; i hope the experiences on the quests and world quests scale with ar level too. I get that it requires us to grind in the game but it really just takes the relevance of quests from the game like it's a huge waste of time. you can just run a domain thrice in 20 minutes for 300 exp instead of trying to finish a quest line for 3hrs for 300 exp\n",
      "No 3. The game is very polished in game mechanics, music, and exploration in a vast world. With a plethora of adventurers, this can be a recipe for greatness. However, this gets bogged down by the terrible monetization which limits how, when and for how long you get to play. Already 2 surveys have gone by and major issues have not been addressed. I can't stress enough that leveling will only get harder past the honeymoon stage. I can't, with good conscience, recommend this until it all gets fixed.\n",
      "No 4. Change this game name to 10min Impact..seriously the domains are fun to play but the resin(stamina) regenerate slow and after 3 boss kill/ 6 domain 20 resin each all u can do is waiting 8min per 1 resin...I'm AR 47 and seriously after daily commission n domain for 10 minutes just turn off..others say farm material I had enough of it I can lvl 90 5 of my char when reach AR50. .just do something with this ridiculous resin regenerate..1* just for the game graphic.\n",
      "No 5. Review Update: After reaching AR 35 you can't do anything. No quest anymore and it is very ultra super mega hard to find the remaining geoculus for the quest. Update the quest system. Most players are stock of nothing because there's nothing to do after or before reaching AR40. I forgot, the mora system is kinda sucks. Only 1k mora per quest but the upgrade requires more than 20k mora for 1 level. Lol. The resin system also kinda sucks. It takes forever to fill.\n",
      "No 6. This game hates letting player progress their characters. They just announced a tweak to their resin system but it just proves this company doesnt care about the real concerns of their player base. They need to increase the regen speed of their resin system, provide more ways to obtain more resin in a day, or have more activities that do not require resin.\n",
      "No 7. It was good and all but i have 1 complaint! Why is the OCEANID SO STRONG it's not even a weekly boss! It's too op! You will have to use a lot of healing and stuff in order to kill it! And That's the only way to get those upgrades for my hyrdro element characters! I can't even upgrade them because THIS OCEANID IS TOO FREAKING STRONG!\n",

      "No 1. I know I am the only one cant play this game cuz when I finished the download, I started the game and poof, character face is gone, literally! Its so slow to rotate. I even cant see where to go since the grass is very bright! And i cant see the mountain, river, castle or anywhere! It took me 17 hour to find the lake. Fix it. The data isnt load properly. I cant see where I have to go. Literally whenever i want to see, the is nothing there. No tree, no mountain, nothing, just a water.\n",
      "No 2. A horrifying experience. Was unable to see the faces of the characters, and also I cannot see the dragon, and Paimon sometimes, thus resulting in me having no idea where to go. When fighting, I cannot see the enemies, leaving me with no choice but to randomly and hopefully shoot at the enemies without knowing where the enemies are. Horrifying to see the faces of the character disappear and the enemies popping up randomly and disappearing immediately. Also, the bridges become invisible sometim\n",
      "No 3. It’s cool, but I can’t play. I couldn’t see 10 steps ahead of me. The sky, waters were all black. Also anything beyond 10 steps were also black. Whenever I touched water my character would be covered in white glow that covers half the screen. I couldn’t play any of the cutscenes. The audio in the cutscenes were laggy and static. Also, due to me not being able to see past 10 steps I couldn’t see the storm dragon. I can’t get pass the first village or whatever.\n",

      "No 5. Not working Hello I have been waiting for this game to come out in ages because i fell in love with the game called Honkai. Since this was mihoyo’s new game I’d say let’s give it a try. The store said that it’s compatible with my phone so I downloaded it. When opening i find myself on a blank white screen , then it immediately turns into a half and half black and white screen. Can you please fix that. This is my second time to redownload it again and the same problem still occurs.\n",
      "No 6. I thought When I was looking at this game on the App Store it says that it is compatible with my phone which is an iPhone 7 but when I went into the app it showed a white screen then it would go half black and then kick me out of the app entirely and I saw people playing this game on the iPhone 7 on YouTube and to be honest I’m kinda disappointed that it hasn’t been fixed to let people play it on the iPhone 7, I really hope it gets fixed soon.\n",
      "No 7. Wont Load Up So a lot of my friends we’re playing this game so I thought to give it a try, well I couldn’t even do that. I made sure my data was 4/4 bars LTE and everytime I clicked the app on my iPhone 7s plus the screen would appear white. Half would go black and then it would send me back to my home screen. I restarted my device and I even connected to wifi. Same thing happened.\n",

      "No 1. Hard gated by Resin system (Stamina). Character drop rate is too low 0.3/0.6%. World feels empty after playing 1 week of play. Very little premium currency given. Real character pity is 180 summons, you can't guarantee character without spending cash. Shop packs are terrible value. RNG heavy gear system (worse than epic seven/SW). Devs didn't listen to CN player feedback, once players progress through the game enough they will see through the facade. This game won't last long unless Devs change\n",
      "No 2. 5 star rating at the star but end game about week 1 star rating because of the resine system that we get 120 resine max which recover 1 resine per 8 minutes that will take about 20hours from 0 to 120 to recover.And 40 resine is required to farm 1 boss per one farm.Means 3 boss farm per day.And the material u need fram that boss is about 8 to 10 that will take 3 days of farm just to level up 1 character and need to level atleast4 character. U still need to level up your weapon more resine needed\n",
      "No 3. Rates to roll characters are too low (0.6%), even if I spent money its not worth it. I have a higher chance of winning the lottery. Need to remove weapons for the guaranteed 4* or pity pull rate. I've played tons of gacha and the rate of this is by far the worst, it will not last long. Look how well Dragalia Lost is doing once they changed their model to give tons of free rolls and roll currencies and upped their rates. No incentive, loots are trash and dungeons not worth the effort.\n",
      "No 4. Love the game, hate the energy system. Compared to other gacha game, GI daily energy is too limited. All players will reach endgame at some point. At that point what can they do? Login, play 8 minutes and all resins are used up? Exploring? Lol, good luck getting meaningful artifacts, enough exp books, enough mora (gold) to build a unit. --- If Mihoyo wants GI to be focused more on exploration, please make exploring more rewarding to balance out the bad energy system.\n",
      "No 5. I had to lower my rating . by 2 star . why? after u hit AR lvl 30-35-40 u have nothing to do . U want to do domain resin . u want to farm mora resin . u want to kill boss resin . this game only gve us 120 resin a day it mean u can only kill boss such as flower boss or the puzzle one 3 time for wolf and stormterror it required 60 resin mean u can only do 2 time . for domain 6 time bcouse it cost 20 resin . u cant grind bcouse resin limit u . 😒\n",
      "No 6. Great game, insidious pratices. Resin, gacha, and barren world. At the beginning, it will give you a plentiful world with a lot of things to do, but as you hit rank 30 your world will be dried up. No method to replenish that content filled world. This is the first trick. Give you the illusion of having a lot to do. Then the Resin hits you. Everything to build your characters is heavily gated. Want to test out characters? Too bad, you better plan ahead. Want good weapons and chars? You Wish.\n",
      "No 7. Gacha system rates are grim. The guranteed pulls from the pity system are pointless with mixed pools. You can end up with a weapon you may not be able to use rather than a character. The resin system is their idea of spending energy except the max cap is extremely low and the costs to do things is very high. You will essentially be gated from actively doing beneficial content when you hit about rank 18. Co-op content is abysmal with nothing to do except pickup trash.\n",

      "No 1. Sorry to give this 1 star rating.. The game is really good the graphics and all. However Im a auto gameplay type of player and this game does not have that. Also you can only play this game through a good PC set up or Play Station. Not intended for mobile specially phones that are not super high end. I have a phone that can handle BDM COD PUBG and they run really smoothly however in this game its like slow motion. This is my rating for your game Thank you\n",
      "No 2. Note' there's a lot of players out there have minimum specs decices, those minimum specs should be enough to run the game if the game indeed well optimize. The game is still good at my realme 5 3/32. At the beginning the game is still okay but the longer I play the ram consumption is getting higher I know the game is really but u can still optimize it for the lower end devices. Please add option to disable ragdoll and shadows, kindly apply how Battle royale games have been optimized\n",
      "No 3. Good game, great game even. I play on a Google pixel 3a XL. It's good, but sometimes the game doesn't run very well, but that's my own fault because I have max settings at 30FPS. Now, the thing is, I'm a bit concerned about my speaker. Sometimes while I play (even while muted) my top speaker (the one you put up to your ear when you are calling someone) crackled. I checked and recently the speaker gives barely any audio. Granted, there's audio, but the other speakers over come it. Can I get help?\n",
      "No 4. Seems like a great game but would be a hell of a lot better on the desktop. You guys made a windows version but as far as I know I can't run it through proton/wine. It's already for android which uses the Linux kernel so please educate me if I'm wrong but wouldn't it be easier to port this to the Linux desktop than windows since it's the same kernel? Why don't you support the Linux desktop? Are you just lazy and don't want to \"officially support\" it?\n",
      "No 5. So. To be fair, I play this on PC as well since you can link accounts and play on both. The game itself is great an enjoyable. One major issue for me is optimization on mobile. I have an LG V30 and it's like playing a slideshow on the lowest settings. 30 frames doesn't even help. It's unplayable for me on mobile but great on my PC. I like that I can continue where I left off on a couch, but I'm suffering from performance. Visually awesome, but make the game playable for oldee mobile.\n",
      "No 6. I Love this Game but hate to say this. Cant play Much cause my Phone Vivo Y19 cant handle the Game Got 4Gb Ram and 128gb of Rom Still cant play the game. Sad. Hope for the next Update Consider People Who dont have a High end Phone or PC to Play. Thanks\n",
      "No 7. The game is really good, however I can't really recommend the mobile version because of some issues. Notably the game uses battery really fast, and while this is mostly a personal preference, I find the camera settings to be lacking, with no way to disable or change the default camera angle.\n",

Six duplicates are needed to max out a character. Aside from that, the resin/stamina system is horribly gated as it feels more restrictive than any other gacha. The open world isn't as lucrative/expansive as you might think. Stale atm\n",
      "No 7. 1. Gacha system - gacha is extremely merciless, rate for a 5* unit is 0.06% which is pretty damn abyssmal even by the market standard. On top of that, theres a 50% your 5* roll will be a weapon instead of a new character, so chance of 5* character is 0.03%. 2. Primogems - given their low gacha rate, you would think they would be more generous with their primogems handout, but no. Its only 5-10 gems per achievement and you need 160 for a SINGLE roll. In short: save your time, play smth else.\n",

And not proprietary controller support (eg ps4 xbox) but generic controller support i wana be able to plug my hdmi cable in and use my Bluetooth controller its more fun playing games like this that way. I'll update my rating when u add controller support. In a game like this that should be standard. Instant 2 point removal\n",

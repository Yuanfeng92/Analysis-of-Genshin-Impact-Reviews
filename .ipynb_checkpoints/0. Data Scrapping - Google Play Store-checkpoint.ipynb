       " 'comments': ['Having so much fun. I usually don\\'t okay Gacha games since I feel like the mechanics are against you. But with this game, even as a casual F2P player, there\\'s so much fun to be had with the PvE element of online coop. While there are \"Great\" characters, there aren\\'t really any \"bad characters\". Every character at the highest level can play off each other and be effective and useful.',\n",
       "  'A really good looking game and a great story! Overall satisfied, the only complaint is all the different types of things you need like wishes and such to summon, it was confusing and also takes a while to earn them. I would recommend adding the ability to move the controls location on the screen would be really nice to have, I could play more comfortably with some small adjustments to where the buttons and \"joystick\" are.',\n",
       "  \"This game is amazing. It is seriously a dream come true for free-to-play players. It has beautiful graphics, amazing scenery, characters with their OWN unique power abilities(with very talented voice acting!) and not to mention the open-world where you can just waste your time and escape out of reality. You don't want to do any quests and instead go around and talk to every NPC in Monstadt ? Sure! (The option to talk to a lot of NPC's with their own commisions is seriously cool.)\",\n",
       "  \"This is a very addictive game!! Excellent graphics and different events are coming out consistently. I love the way that this game doesn't have pvp or arena so that I only have to focus on getting my favourite characters instead of focusing on meta. The world is also big and nice to explore. Hoping that more areas would be unlocked ASAP for more exploration. Keep up the good work!!\",\n",
       "  \"Hope this review gets attention... I am still on the very initial levels, but I still love the game. Bringing a game like Genshin Impact on mobile is truly legendary. My device has somewhat mid-level performance. I read reviews telling it puts stress on such phones, it's true. If the developers can still improve it, it's fantastic. The game at its current stage is still good. I felt that it should have controller support and cross-platform sync, so you can also continue playing on your console.\",\n",
       "  \"Thought I had to come back and do a proper review, just to give credit to the team who made this happen. By far, one of the best ARPG I've ever played. If you're into great storyline, wonderful scenic view, going on an adventure to pass your weekend afternoon, this is your best bet. Hope my contribution helps to drown out those bad reviews because I really think everyone deserves to at least try this out instead of looking at 'bad' reviews and giving it a pass.\",\n",
       "  \"Love this game but there is an issue. Whenever I try to aim with bow characters i can't move they're aim, the only way I can aim while playing is by putting the camera in a certain position which helps me make the shot, but is difficult in battle. Another issue is in the beginning of the game when you meet amber, it has you shoot with her, which I can't and not only that but it doesn't let you take her out of aiming mode which is making is impossible for me to play.\",\n",
       "  'Certainly is the best mobile game I played so far. I was fan of asphalt 9, but when I started playing Genshin Impact, it was on a whole different level. Yeah, the storage of the game is a bit much excess, but it is surely worth it. Very addictive and appreciable game. Started the day it released, not even a single complaint for me. The devs are also generous in compensating the players with in-game rewards and many more good stuff. It is truly a game worth your while, if you have a good device.',\n",
       "  \"The best mobile game I've played so far. I still can't believe how this game runs smoothly on mobile. Gacha elements aside, this game has beautiful visuals, vast open world that's great for exploration, fun and challenging combat, and intriguing story with fully voiced characters during cutscenes. This game is definitely a step forward in terms of mobile gaming.\",\n",
       "  \"Reviewing this on a Samsung A51. First and foremost, I love this game, I've put over 300 hours in on the PC now. Highly recommend it to anyone. However, as a mobile experience I cannot recommend this: It is a large download with long loading times, as expected, but the lag and graphical quality aren't up to scratch at all. You really don't get to appreciate the world to anywhere near the extent you can even on console. Save yourself the disappointment, play this on a different platform.\",\n",
       "  \"This game is absolutely amazing. I had no idea what I was getting in to when I decided to download this. Genshin impact became one of my favorite games ever incredibly quickly. Its massive open world exploration and collection mixed with rpg hack and slash team elements makes it one of the most fun games I've ever played. Wanna scale that mountain? Do it. Kill those enemies for some loot? Have at it. Constant upgrading and leveling keeps the game fresh. Simply put, its awesome.\",\n",
       "  \"The game is amazing. Simply the best mobile game with beautiful design and wonderful story. I really enjoy the free roam in this game and the controls aren't bad. This game isnt supposed to be able to be completed in one day, so resin system is ok. Not the best but still appropriate. Gacha pulls are a bit of a problem because rates are low and primogems are hard to obtain.\",\n",
       "  \"So far this is a really beautiful game and I love the characters to pieces already, the only thing that has frustrated me so far is that I can't pet the dogs!! I know its so minor but if there was a feature added where you could pet the animals it would make me enjoy the game that much more! Other than that this game is great and the graphics are very pleasing!\",\n",
       "  \"Very happy with this game. There's a ton of things to do, see and explore. The world is MASSIVE. In the beginning, just pick a few favorite heros, and focus on them. There are so many heros to choose from you'll get overwhelmed quickly if you try to spread out your resources. Once your well into the game, it won't be a problem anymore. Its beautiful and is really polished. I'm enjoying the story.\",\n",
       "  'Genshin Impact is about as good as a \"mobile\" game can get. I put mobile in quotes because the game can be played on both Playstation and PC for a smoother and more refined experience but that isn\\'t to say that the mobile version of the game is bad whatsoever. Depending on the hardware you\\'re using the game might run perfect but I\\'ve definitely noticed stuttering, texture pop in, long load times, and sometimes crashes on my Pixel 4A. It\\'s not perfect, but for the price of free, it\\'s a steal.',\n",
       "  \"This game really should be paid, its easily worth $15 or $20. Probsbly more. Supreme open world and the storyline is fabulous, with wonderful anime graphics. I only have 10 games on my phone, the ones I consider classics. This quickly became just that, and it'll now never leave. I hate single player games that require internet connection, but this one here? This is the only one like that I've found worthwhile 110%\",\n",
       "  \"I'm a f2p player. This game is the best game I ever played either on mobile or PC!! The graphics and all are great. The very game I've always wanted to play! Congratulations on being the best game of 2020 and keep up with it! I'm really expecting for the developments and the others! Maybe someday there could be updates that can make we PvP. But the game is already great as is!!\",\n",
       "  \"I love this game. I even have it on PS4. I love how its open world and that it has a story mode and quests, but they don't monopolize the game. If you wanna just got wondering around you can or go back to the story/quests anytime you want. Although I get a little frustrated with the whole adventure rank thing sometimes. Graphic are great too. Be extra careful setting your birthday though. Once its set you can't change it at all. (Found that out on my PS4 sadly).\",\n",
       "  \"At first, the game is a little boring. You have to get through certain quests and level up to get everything unlocked like daily quests, daily commisions, story quests, ect. But I've been enjoying it a lot lately. Some people are flying through the game while im just taking my time. I love the variety of characters, but Im upset because I missed the Venti banner, so hopefully they redo characters as they put up new banners? (Though the game takes ALOT of GB, so be prepared for it)\",\n",
       "  \"Good game overall, but lacking in a few areas. Mainly for me the controls don't always feel responsive (both touch screen and PS4) and the camera can be quite poor (especially in combat). Also as with any gacha the rates are awefull, which is fine normally, except you need certain elements for effective combat and puzzles. So bad pulls can really hold you back in this game. On a side note for the new glider event, it's terrible. Poor camera, unclear courses and jerky controls.\",\n",
       "  \"So far this has been a really fun game!!! I can hardly believe that it's actually mobile. It's so open world, and has a feel of the Zelda for the switch. Really fun and interesting. The only problem is it makes my phone overheat and make a weird sound. Pretty intensive! Edit: There has been a few problems qirh some of the boss mosters disappearing in a glitch after they jump. The water boss had a few glitches, and sometimes the electric square boss will stay up in the air. Still a solid game\",\n",
       "  \"First gatcha game that I really enjoy playing. Best part is you don't have to pay if you don't want to. There are plenty of opportunities to collect primagems without opening your wallet. Graphics are absolutely gorgeous! Well known voice actors for the characters. Diverse characters and an interesting story! It really is a great game. Super excited to see what's next in the world of Teyvat.\",\n",
       "  \"Beautiful.. (31/10) (1/12) After a month of playing, I still really enjoyed the game. I love that the 4* character can shine next to other 5* character. All the characters seems to have balanced skill and ability and I hoped the developer can maintain the balance throughout the life of the game. What I really hate about the gacha game is when the old character get obsolete after the new character is pumped to the player. Just please don't do that okay. 👍\",\n",
       "  \"While there are thing to complain about for this game, compared to all other gacha games this one is truly amazing. What I love aside from the visuals and story is the fact that you actually control and use the characters that you have and they each have their own playstyle. Other games you put your new character on a team and they do the same stuff (ie. tapping their abilities when it's their turn) but with different abilities. In Genshin, you feel the difference between each unique character.\",\n",
       "  \"The game itself is excellent. Has a great variety of characters and is fun to play in a nice looking world. Why 2 stars because heaven forbid you have a customer service issue since you email them and have you wait two days to slap you with a pre generated response. Why should I explain my situation if you're going to send me an email back with something that clearly shows that you either didn't read it or don't care. I love the game but terrible customer service drags you down to 2 stars.\",\n",
       "  \"I love how it's an open world not based around competition. For once I can casually enjoy a game without having to worry about stats for some PVP concept or Leaderboards to watch out for. Even with a gacha game concept in it, honestly, does it really matter as much if there's ways to utilize the characters you DO get and strategize with them and the elemental reactions. I love it. 🥺 It's perfect for ME, because not everyone will think the same. I can play even with my hectic schedule at work.\",\n",
       "  \"It is the best game I've ever played and always will be. I've never felt this much emotion playing a game before, the stories are strong, well made and some of them makes me want to tear up. This game has the most beautiful OSTs, endless content, visuals are just phenomenal and the characters are amazing. I've never given this much praise to anything in my life. 11/10\",\n",
       "  'I can play the game in the Monstadt part of the map. Though I have graphics and control issues, specifically in defeating Dvalin and aiming when using long ranged characters such as Amber and Diona, I was able to tolerate it because of the storyline, however, when I started doing the Rite of the Descension quest, specifically the \"Watching the Rite\" part, the game became unresponsive, to the point that I couldn\\'t play anymore. Due to this issue, I can\\'t open my account anymore. Pls fix this asap',\n",
       "  'I love this game! But the aiming skill in some characters is so hard to control! Especially for mobile. Its hard to move the aim. Sometimes it does not move! I hope you fix this.... Other than that! The game is soooo goood! Edit: i have a problem. When i join a server, it says \"server timed out\" i have no idea why.',\n",
       "  'Amazing, just amazing. It is the best mobile game I have played until now. The graphics, the world, the story, everything is just magnificent. But it requires money and more money to level up characters as we move up the levels. It gets extremely difficult to get new characters and level them up. It is not for those who dont want to spend money on games and I am one of them.',\n",
       "  \"From a gameplay and graphical perspective, this game really is great. Inarguably the best looking mobile game out there, but that aside, it's an extremely shallow game and it has tons of big issues. For one, the gacha is horrid. The rates are absolutely miniscule, and the pity requires far too much for far too little gain. Getting primogems to do the gacha is an absolute slog, and is extremely unfun after a certain point. Once you pass AR 25 or so, the game loses its charm and gets very boring.\",\n",
       "  \"The story and overall game play is fun, but there isn't much to do late game. I know the game is still adding more archon and such, but rn, it feels really boring. Everyday, I would just come on, get daily commissions, spend resin, and be done for the day. There isn't much to do afterwards, especially for people like me, who are ar45+ the gacha system also feels really expensive.\",\n",
       "  \"Probably one of the best mobile games I have ever played, I LOVE the art style (and im not much of a fan of anime styles), its got good fighting mechanics, an amazing adventure system, and lots of small-big puzzles hidden throughout the world (just to name a few of my favorite things). Its quite a bit like Zelda, but its not a total ripoff. I'd love to see more weapons for every character type!!!\",\n",
       "  \"The graphics are absolutely gorgeous! The characters, the voice acting, the adventure, storyline, music, everything is amazing! The only reason why I rated it 4 stars was because of slight audio problems and glitching, as well as camera problems. My camera sometimes moves in one direction without me touching anything, or the audio cuts out briefly. Regardless, I highly recommend this game! I play on mobile, so it's a bit laggy but I'm assuming that's normal. You should definitely play!\",\n",
       "  \"I've played this game for only a few days, but honestly it's such an amazing adventure. The story is rich with intresting characters and deep lore. The graphics are steller for a moble release of a larger game. The only reason this game gets a 4/5 is due to the sound being glitchy save for cutscenes. My Android updated recently, and apparently that caused the gain of the voice overs and soundtrack to pop every so often. I hope this game fixes this issue soon. I'd like to hear the game.\",\n",
       "  \"First, it's RPG, not MMORPG; so don't complain. Secondly, it's F2P-able; I don't understand how being an F2P is a problem here other than you suck at managing. Third, it's a gacha game; you are anchored to a massively low droprate for a high-rarity item/character and dude, Original Resin is limited, yes but it can recharge over time! Maybe it's just me that already played a lot of games with these kinds of mechanism but this is not a problem at all. That's all.\",\n",
       "  \"As a fellow anime lover and botw fan, I simply couldn't wait for this game's release. This game was a breath of fresh, yet familiar air with a beautiful environment, unique characters, and a solid story along with side quests!... Sadly, that's where it ends. The post game content is... lacking and the gache is vastly p2w in need of adjusting. Also, with no initial elite dungeons, why get stronger?----In time, this may all be adjusted, but for now... I see no reason to get back on. '^'\",\n",
       "  \"I'm very fond of mihoyo and their games so this game was no exception and I had to download it. When I did it was a complete shock. The world building is very interesting and the characters are pretty cool. I love all the small details they added and just wanting to try out everything. It keeps me going because there's always something to do, I would def recommend this to anyone who loves open world exploration.\",\n",
       "  \"This game looks like a mobile version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild. Optimization of the game is good and, graphics look great. But game wants a lot of storage space. Do not download this game if you are running low on storage space. It's worth to play if your phone processor is strong enough to open it properly. Processors of older generation phones will not be able to open this game. - Best mobile game I've ever played.\",\n",
       "  \"You can tell a lot of love (and money) went into the game. The graphics are gorgeous and there are surprisingly deep storylines, even in the side characters. If you've seen a trailer, then go ahead and expect that level of detail in the actual game. Aim controls can be a little tricky on mobile and sometimes sound quality might dip a bit during action sequences (I'm using a Galaxy S10), but otherwise good gameplay. Highly recommend!\"],\n",

I hope the game developer's want just focus on adding more characters over and over , instead of that they should add more Skills, talents enhancments to the same characters. More events , but at the weekend since people have life . More to that , they should enhance the game environment ,balance it, fix Dvalin it has several buggs .

I used to play it so much but there's not much to play anymore so I don't play as much. This is a personal frustration but I'm not getting a 5 star character at all. I almost resort to using my money but I realized it's a waste of money. In my opinion, this game can improve more on better contents and I feel like the story part is short.\",\n",

Everything in the game is focused towards pyro characters, so if you don't have Diluc or Klee, you're going to be at a huge disadvantage in combat.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"if you weigh the good of this game against the bad, you will get a middling result. which i would agree with. the main problem i have with this game is the gacha pool for this game is not like other gacha games. In other games , new characters go into the base pool of characters available to get from summons after their banner ends. The trade off is paying a premium to access the characters sooner. In this game, new characters do not go into the base pool. This means you will never have access to most the game's content, as it is always with a limited character pool. I am used to very stingy, terrible rates for summons, like with epic 7. But this game goes one step further with the way it handles banners. I cannot , and do not support the gacha in this game. I do not recommend you do either. If you want a middling experience, play the game, as a f2p player and enjoy the content. There is little to no end game, and little content to do besides the story. The daily content is stamina based, with 20 stamina used for 2 to 5 minutes of gameplay in a dungeon. It costs 60 stamina for a weekly boss. You only receiving 120 stamina a day. Meaning you will only have about 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay a day where you are making meaningful progress. You can burn through your stamina 2x faster than that, if you use the condensed resin. Having played a long time, the potential for a great game is here, like with many games. The developers have not fully realized the potential yet. Maybe in a year or two, they will have. Right now, in my opinion it feels very much like an early access game. Most mobile games , gacha games, release with a full and complete story mode. This game does not have that. The content stops after a certain point. You cannot beat the story, there is very little to do. Do not become too invested in this incomplete game, do not spend too much money, or expect it to be a completely fulfilling experience. It is not, it is very much a work in progress. With the amount of investment this game asks for, there is very little payoff. If this was not a live service game, I would rate this 2 stars. In about 6 months I believe they will have earned the 3 star rating I give them now.\",\n",

You can get about 1,800 primogems in a month which is equal to 11 pulls. I would be ok with that if they added a daily log in. Considering this is a gacha game and it doesn't have a daily log in system is dreadful. I think this game will bleed out players first before they make changes. This game is only chasing whales and don't care about F2P Playe\",\n",

F2p players will probably have a hard time accepting how hard the system works. I think the company should make the system a bit easier, to please the gamers. Apart from that, great game.\",\n",

I understand there aren't many characters, but I'm tired of getting 10x 3 star weapons when the banner lies and claims I can get at least SOMETHING 4 star per 10 tries. I always choose to do 10x wishes. I never get characters, let alone a 5 star. Controls are often questionable during combat. Unresponsive & unnecessarily hard to switch targets.\",\n",

There are quite a few problems with the game currently, the biggest being it limits the player to 15-30 minutes of playtime a day that they can make any meaningful progress. Once you finish the main story, the game becomes a cycle of logging in, spending your energy resources to farm for materials, and logging out. The energy recharges so damn slow (hence the low daily playtime), you would need to repeat this for up to a whole year to have enough to fully gear your active team. Fixes were repeatedly suggested by the community, but the devs decide to ignore it completely. Until they decide to listen, I cannot recommend this to anyone else.

       "  'content': \"Please Read This Review It Took Some Time - Genshin Impact is a astonishing game, it gives a helpful feature that can be used to sync you profile data between multiple platforms, I often use it between my phone and PC, the sync quality is amazing if I were to exit the app on mobile and come back it will bring me to where i just left off, despite the fact the the game still moves and you might die in that time period. This game is completely free to play and you can win the game and do everything that all the people that pay do. This game may need some more attention then your other games do because this game is new and updates will be frequent, you also need to keep in mind the game has limited time items from event, even if you don't get to the event in time - usually longer than a week - you can try to hope a event with the same items come again, I for one have missed an event for a character (Barbara-Hydro) but by the time I finished writing this review I got a Twitter notification that a event for my character (Barbara-Hydro) was available, so if you miss a event just hope the event hasn't been put out to may times already, but I the character you want just doesn't have and event for it you could also make some wishes to get your character! This game also has a large map (even bigger than most of my PC games maps), you can traverse to many places with different methods of transportation (Gliding, swimming and walking-gliding is only available after you finish the first couple tasks with Amber-Pyro)! The only issues I want to point out is that this has a large download file but it is worth it because of the syncing you can do with your other platforms (PlayStation, Desktop/Laptop, Switch-SoonToBe, and Mobile). The next issue I have is the massive power consumption, I only found out about this after my phone gave me and alert that the game was taking a lot of my phones battery so if your phone doesn't have a good battery then I advise you not to get the mobile app and instead get the console or laptop versions. This is also a multiplayer game but there aren't any co-operative missions yet since this review and it is mostly just to level up and collect materials between each player/friend's world. This is it for my review (this took 30 minutes I am happy you took your time to read my review) :D\",\n",
